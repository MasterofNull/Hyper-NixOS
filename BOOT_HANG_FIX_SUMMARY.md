# Boot Hang Fix - Quick Summary

## Problem
System hangs during boot after multi-user.target is reached and never completes boot.

## Root Causes Fixed

### 1. **Circular Dependencies** ⚠️ Critical
- Services waited for multi-user.target while being part of multi-user.target
- **Fixed**: Removed multi-user.target from `after` dependencies

### 2. **Type = "notify" Services** ⚠️ Critical  
- Services didn't send systemd-notify signal, causing infinite wait
- **Fixed**: Changed to Type = "simple" or added timeouts

### 3. **Type = "idle" Blocking** ⚠️ High
- Services waited for all other services, causing deadlock
- **Fixed**: Changed to Type = "oneshot"

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |

| `modules/automation/backup-dedup.nix` | Added timeout |

## How to Apply

```bash
# Method 1: Rebuild from updated repository
cd /etc/nixos
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
sudo reboot

# Method 2: Manual update (if you have the repo)
cd /path/to/Hyper-NixOS
git pull
sudo cp -r modules /etc/nixos/
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
sudo reboot
```

## Verification

After reboot, check:
```bash
# Should complete quickly (30-90 seconds)
systemd-analyze

# Should show no failed services (or only optional ones)
systemctl --failed

# Should show reasonable boot time
systemd-analyze blame
```

## Expected Results

✅ Boot completes successfully  
✅ System reaches login prompt  
✅ Core services are running  
⚠️ Some advanced services may be disabled (can enable manually)

## Quick Status Check

```bash
# Check these services are OK
systemctl status libvirtd
systemctl status hypervisor-web-dashboard

# Check boot was successful
systemctl is-system-running
# Should output: "running" or "degraded" (not "starting" or "initializing")
```
