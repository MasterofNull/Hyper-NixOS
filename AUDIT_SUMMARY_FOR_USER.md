   - Test: `nixos-rebuild dry-build --show-trace`
   - **Time**: 30 minutes

### High Priority (Next) 🟡

4. **Standardize 119 Scripts**
   - Use common libraries (scripts/lib/)
   - Eliminate code duplication
   - **Time**: 2-3 days

5. **Add Missing Security Features**
   - IDS/IPS system
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - **Time**: 1-2 days

### Medium Priority (Later) 🟢

6. **Complete Missing Features** (18 features)
   - VPN server, distributed storage, dev tools
   - **Time**: 1-2 weeks

7. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Unit tests, integration tests, CI/CD
   - **Time**: 1 week

## 📁 What I Created

### Audit Documentation
1. **SYSTEM_AUDIT_REPORT.md** (400+ lines)
   - Detailed analysis of every component
   - Scoring breakdown by category
   - Specific issues identified
   - Recommendations

2. **AUDIT_ACTION_PLAN.md**
   - Phased improvement plan
