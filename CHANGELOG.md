## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 0.9.x to 1.0.0

1. **Backup your configuration:**
   ```bash
   sudo cp -r /etc/nixos /etc/nixos.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

2. **Review breaking changes:**
   - Privilege separation is now mandatory (not opt-in)
   - Password protection module is always enabled
   - Some wizard scripts renamed (use `hv` command)

3. **Update configuration:**
   ```bash
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch
   ```

4. **Verify functionality:**
   ```bash
   hv help
   virsh list --all
   ```

### Upgrading from 0.5.x to 1.0.0

Due to significant architectural changes, we recommend a fresh installation for upgrades from 0.5.x. Contact support for assistance with data migration.

## Deprecation Notices

### Deprecated in 1.0.0
- **Old wizard naming**: `setup_wizard.sh` â†’ Use `hv setup` instead
- **Direct script execution**: Run wizards via `hv` command for consistency
- **Unprotected sudo**: All new sudo rules are granular and specific

### Removed in 1.0.0
- Legacy credential storage (migrated to secure storage)
- Unrestricted NOPASSWD sudo rules
- Hardcoded configuration paths

## Support and Resources
