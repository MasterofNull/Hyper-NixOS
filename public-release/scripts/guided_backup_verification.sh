║     Welcome to Backup Verification - Learn Disaster Recovery  ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

CRITICAL QUESTION:
If your disk died right now, could you recover your VMs?

Many people have backups. Few people have TESTED backups.
Untested backups are wishful thinking, not disaster recovery.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:

• Why backup testing is critical (real horror stories)
• How to verify backup integrity
• How to test restore procedures
• Industry best practices (3-2-1 rule)
• Disaster recovery planning

WHAT WE'LL DO:

1. Find your backups
2. Verify file integrity (no corruption)
3. Test restore to temporary location
4. Verify restored VM boots
5. Document recovery procedures
6. Generate verification report

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

REAL-WORLD STORY:

Company X had nightly backups for 3 years.
Never tested them.
Server died.
Tried to restore.
Every backup was corrupt.
Lost everything.
Went out of business.

Don't be Company X.

                    BACKUP TYPES EXPLAINED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THREE TYPES OF VM BACKUPS:

1. SNAPSHOT (Instant, but risky)
   • Takes seconds
   • Uses minimal space (copy-on-write)
   • Depends on original disk
   • ⚠️ If disk dies, snapshot dies too
   
   When to use: Quick rollback before updates
   NOT a real backup!

2. FULL BACKUP (Complete copy)
   • Takes time (copies everything)
   • Uses lots of space
   • Independent of original
   • ✓ Real disaster recovery
   
   When to use: Regular backups
   This is a REAL backup!

3. INCREMENTAL (Space efficient)
   • Only backs up changes
   • Saves space
   • Faster than full
   • Requires full backup + all incrementals
   
   When to use: Daily backups
   Advanced technique!

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    THE 3-2-1 RULE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INDUSTRY STANDARD:
• 3 copies of your data
• 2 different media types (disk + tape/cloud)
• 1 copy offsite (different location)

YOUR SETUP:
• Original VM (on host)
• Backup (on host disk) ← You are here
• Need: Offsite copy (cloud/external drive)

NEXT LEVEL:
Consider:
• Copy to external drive weekly
• Or: Upload to cloud (AWS S3, Backblaze)
• Or: Copy to remote server

• Or backups stored elsewhere

To set up automated backups:
1. Run: sudo /etc/hypervisor/scripts/automated_backup.sh backup all
2. Or: sudo systemctl enable --now hypervisor-backup.timer

LEARNING POINT:
Always know where your backups are!
Document your backup location and schedule.

BACKUP FILE FORMATS:

• .qcow2 files = VM disk images
  These are complete VM disks you can boot directly
  
• .tar.gz files = Compressed archives
  These contain VM config + disk, need extraction

WHAT WE'LL CHECK:
1. File is not corrupt (integrity check)
2. File is accessible (permissions check)
3. File size is reasonable (not truncated)
4. File can be restored (actual restore test)

WHAT: Checking if backup file is corrupt

WHY IT MATTERS:
Backup files can become corrupt due to:
• Disk errors (bad sectors)
• Incomplete writes (power loss during backup)
• Bit rot (data degradation over time)
• Transfer errors (if copied between systems)

WHAT WE'RE CHECKING:
• File exists and is readable
• File size is not zero
• File format is valid
• (For qcow2) Image header is intact

HOW TO CHECK:
We'll use 'qemu-img check' - it verifies:
• Header integrity
• Internal consistency
• Allocation table validity

TRANSFERABLE SKILL:
qemu-img works with:
• QCOW2 (QEMU)
• VDI (VirtualBox)
• VMDK (VMware)
• VHD (Hyper-V)

Same tool, different formats!

WHAT: Restore backup to temporary location

WHY IT MATTERS:
Just because a file isn't corrupt doesn't mean you can restore it.

WHAT WE'LL DO:
• Create temporary test directory
• Extract/copy backup to test location
• Verify restored files
• DON'T touch your original backup or VM

WHERE: $TEST_DIR
(We'll clean this up after testing)

SAFE TESTING:
We restore to a temporary location, not over your live VM.
Your original VM is completely safe.

Always test restores in a safe environment first!
Never restore directly to production without testing.
