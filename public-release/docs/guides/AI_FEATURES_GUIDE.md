# AI and Machine Learning Features Guide

## ü§ñ Overview

Hyper-NixOS includes advanced AI and machine learning capabilities for threat detection, behavioral analysis, and security automation. This guide covers how to use and configure these features.

## üéØ AI-Powered Features

### 1. **Behavioral Analysis System**

The behavioral analysis system uses machine learning to detect zero-day threats by identifying anomalous behavior patterns.

#### Configuration
```nix
hypervisor.security.behavioralAnalysis = {
  enable = true;
  modelPath = "/var/lib/hypervisor/ml-models";
  updateInterval = 3600;  # Update models every hour
  
  # Detection sensitivity
  sensitivity = {
    vm = 0.95;      # VM behavior anomaly threshold
    network = 0.98; # Network behavior anomaly threshold
    process = 0.90; # Process behavior anomaly threshold
  };
};
```

#### Features
- **VM Behavior Analysis**: Monitors CPU, memory, and I/O patterns
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Detects unusual communication patterns
- **Process Behavior Analysis**: Identifies suspicious process activities
- **Zero-Day Detection**: Catches previously unknown threats

### 2. **Threat Detection Engine**

Advanced threat detection with multiple ML models working in parallel.

#### Available Models
1. **Isolation Forest**: For outlier detection
2. **Autoencoder**: For pattern recognition
3. **LSTM Networks**: For time-series analysis
4. **One-Class SVM**: For novelty detection

#### Usage
```bash
# Check ML engine status
systemctl status hypervisor-ml-detector

# View detection metrics
journalctl -u hypervisor-behavioral-analyzer -f

# Train models with new data
hypervisor-ml train --model all
```

### 3. **Automated Response System**

AI-driven automated responses to detected threats.

#### Response Modes
- **Monitor Only**: Log threats without action
- **Interactive**: Prompt for user confirmation
- **Automatic**: Execute responses based on severity

#### Configuration
```nix
hypervisor.security.threatResponse = {
  enable = true;
  mode = "interactive";  # or "monitor", "automatic"
  
  # AI-based severity assessment
  useMachineLearning = true;
  
  # Response playbooks
  playbooks = {
    networkThreat = "isolate";
    malwareDetected = "quarantine";
    bruteForce = "block";
  };
};
```

## üìä ML Model Management

### Training Models
```bash
# Train specific model
hypervisor-ml train --model isolation-forest --data /path/to/training/data

# Retrain all models
hypervisor-ml train --all --epochs 100

# Validate model accuracy
hypervisor-ml validate --model network-anomaly
```

### Model Updates
```bash
# Check for model updates
hypervisor-ml update --check

# Download latest models
hypervisor-ml update --download

# Rollback to previous version
hypervisor-ml rollback --model vm-behavior
```

## üîç Monitoring AI Performance

### Dashboard Access
```bash
# Launch AI monitoring dashboard
hypervisor-ai-dashboard

# Or access via web
http://localhost:9091/ai-metrics
```

### Key Metrics
- **Detection Rate**: Percentage of threats caught
- **False Positive Rate**: Incorrect threat identifications
- **Model Accuracy**: Overall ML model performance
- **Processing Latency**: Time to analyze events

### Performance Tuning
```nix
hypervisor.security.mlOptimization = {
  # Adjust based on system resources
  maxCpuUsage = 50;      # Percentage
  maxMemoryUsage = 2048; # MB
  
  # Model update frequency
  retrainInterval = "weekly";
  
  # Feature extraction settings
  features = {
    enableDeepInspection = true;
    samplingRate = 0.1; # Sample 10% of traffic
  };
};
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All ML processing happens locally
- No data is sent to external services
- Training data is encrypted at rest
- Models are signed and verified

### Resource Management
```bash
# Set resource limits
hypervisor-ml config --max-cpu 4 --max-memory 8G

# Enable GPU acceleration (if available)
hypervisor-ml config --enable-gpu

# Optimize for low-resource systems
hypervisor-ml config --profile minimal
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High False Positive Rate
```bash
# Adjust sensitivity
hypervisor-ml config --sensitivity 0.85

# Retrain with local data
hypervisor-ml train --use-local-baseline
```

#### Model Performance Issues
```bash
# Check model health
hypervisor-ml health

# Clear model cache
hypervisor-ml cache --clear

# Reset to defaults
hypervisor-ml reset
```

#### Resource Exhaustion
```bash
# Reduce feature extraction
hypervisor-ml config --features minimal

# Disable real-time analysis
hypervisor-ml config --mode batch
```

## üìö Advanced Configuration

### Custom Model Integration
```python
# /etc/hypervisor/ml-models/custom_model.py
from hypervisor.ml import BaseModel

class CustomThreatModel(BaseModel):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Initialize your model
    
    def predict(self, features):
        # Your prediction logic
        return threat_score
    
    def train(self, data):
        # Your training logic
        pass
```

### Feature Engineering
```nix
hypervisor.security.mlFeatures = {
  # Custom feature extractors
  customExtractors = [
    ./extractors/network_entropy.py
    ./extractors/process_genealogy.py
  ];
  
  # Feature combinations
  featureSets = {
    minimal = [ "cpu" "memory" "network_basic" ];
    standard = [ "cpu" "memory" "network" "disk" "process" ];
    advanced = [ "all" "custom" ];
  };
};
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Regular Model Updates**: Keep models updated with latest threat intelligence
2. **Baseline Establishment**: Run in monitor mode initially to establish normal behavior
3. **Gradual Automation**: Start with interactive mode before enabling automatic responses
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Watch system resources when enabling AI features
5. **Data Retention**: Configure appropriate data retention for model training
