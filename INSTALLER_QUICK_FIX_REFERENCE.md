## Fixed Installation Methods

### ✅ One-Command Install (NOW SAFE)
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MasterofNull/Hyper-NixOS/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```
**Auto-selects defaults, no prompts, no hanging!**

### ✅ Local Install (Interactive)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MasterofNull/Hyper-NixOS.git
cd Hyper-NixOS
sudo ./install.sh
```
**Interactive with 30s timeouts, safe defaults on timeout**

---

## What Was Fixed

| Component | Fix |
|-----------|-----|
| Non-interactive detection | ✅ Added |
| Read timeouts | ✅ 30s per prompt |
| Max retries | ✅ 5 attempts max |
| Default values | ✅ HTTPS clone (option 1) |
| Closed stdin handling | ✅ Detects and uses defaults |

---

## Quick Test

```bash
# Test the fix (should complete in <5 seconds)
echo "" | sudo bash /workspace/install.sh

# Should output:
# "Running in non-interactive mode, using default: Git Clone (HTTPS)"
# Then proceed with installation
```

---

## Safety Guarantees

✅ **Cannot hang** - 30 second timeout per prompt  
✅ **Cannot infinite loop** - Max 5 retries  
✅ **Cannot crash** - Graceful fallbacks  
✅ **Works piped** - Detects non-interactive mode  
✅ **Works interactive** - Full prompts with defaults
