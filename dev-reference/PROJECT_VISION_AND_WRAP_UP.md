# Project Vision & Wrap-Up Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Status:** ✅ **Phases 1 & 2 Complete - Production Ready**

---

## 🎯 Core Vision Statement

**"Create a hypervisor system that guides users through every step with intelligent defaults, helpful suggestions, clear hints, and actionable errors - making success the default outcome."**

### Key Principles

1. **Guide, Don't Gatekeep**
   - Tools should guide users to success
   - Defaults should be secure and sensible
   - Errors should include solutions
   - Every choice should have a recommendation

2. **New Users First, Power Users Always**
   - Design for new users
   - Provide escape hatches for power users
   - Never sacrifice capability for simplicity
   - Progressive disclosure of complexity

3. **Success by Default**
   - Secure defaults out of the box
   - Auto-detection where possible
   - Validation before execution
   - Clear feedback at every step

4. **Respectful Language**
   - "New users" not "new users"
   - "Experienced users" not "experts"
   - Assume intelligence, not knowledge
   - Empower, don't condescend

---

## 🛠️ How We Guide Users

### 1. Intelligent Defaults

**Philosophy:** Users shouldn't need to know every option to succeed.

**Examples from Implementation:**
```bash
# VM Creation - Sensible defaults provided
disk_gb=${USER_INPUT:-20}     # Default: 20GB if not specified
arch=${DETECTED_ARCH:-x86_64} # Default: Auto-detected
memory=${SUGGESTED:-4096}      # Default: Suggested based on available RAM
```

**Future Enhancements:**
- Auto-detect optimal CPU count
- Suggest memory based on available RAM
- Recommend disk size based on ISO type
- Pre-fill network based on host config

### 2. Helpful Suggestions

**Philosophy:** Guide users toward best practices.

**Examples from Implementation:**
```bash
# Setup Wizard - Recommendations built-in
$DIALOG --yesno "Enable strict firewall (recommended for security)?\n\nRecommended: Yes (secure)" 10 70

# ISO Manager - Auto-verification with suggestion
$DIALOG --msgbox "Downloaded and verified: $filename\n\nRecommended: Remove ISO from profile after OS install" 10 60
```

**Future Enhancements:**
```bash
# CPU Pinning Suggestion
if [ $TOTAL_CPUS -gt 4 ]; then
  $DIALOG --yesno "System has $TOTAL_CPUS CPUs.\n\nRecommended: Pin VM to CPUs 0-1 for better performance?\n(Host will use CPUs 2-$TOTAL_CPUS)" 12 70
fi

# Memory Suggestion
AVAILABLE_MEM=$(free -m | awk '/^Mem:/{print $7}')
SUGGESTED_MEM=$((AVAILABLE_MEM / 2))
$DIALOG --inputbox "Memory for VM (MB)?\n\nAvailable: ${AVAILABLE_MEM}MB\nRecommended: ${SUGGESTED_MEM}MB (50% of available)" 12 60 "$SUGGESTED_MEM"
```

### 3. Clear Hints

**Philosophy:** Context matters. Explain what options mean.

**Examples from Implementation:**
```bash
# VM Action Menu - Descriptive labels
action=$($DIALOG --title "VM: $name" --menu "Status: $state\nChoose action:" 18 70 9 \
  "1" "Start/Resume VM" \
  "2" "Launch Console (SPICE/VNC)" \
  "3" "View VM Status" \
  ...

# Diagnostic Tool - Explanatory messages
echo "✓ KVM device present: /dev/kvm"
echo "  KVM enables hardware virtualization for better performance"
```

**Future Enhancements:**
```bash
# Bridge Network Creation - Explain impact
$DIALOG --yesno "Create bridged network?\n\n\
What this does:\n\
- VMs get IPs on your local network\n\
- VMs accessible from other computers\n\
- Useful for: servers, shared services\n\n\
Alternative: Use 'default' network (NAT)\n\
- VMs isolated but have internet\n\
- Useful for: testing, desktop VMs\n\n\
Recommended for new users: Use 'default' (NAT)\n\n\
Create bridge anyway?" 20 70
```

### 4. Actionable Errors

**Philosophy:** Every error should tell you exactly how to fix it.

**Examples from Implementation:**
```bash
# Dependency Missing - With Solution
echo "Error: Missing required dependencies: ${missing[*]}" >&2
echo "" >&2
echo "To install on NixOS:" >&2
for dep in "${missing[@]}"; do
  case "$dep" in
    jq) echo "  nix-env -iA nixpkgs.jq" >&2 ;;
    virsh) echo "  Enable virtualisation.libvirtd in configuration.nix" >&2 ;;
  esac
done

# Disk Creation Failed - With Diagnostic
echo "Error: Failed to create disk image" >&2
echo "  Path: $qcow" >&2
echo "  Size: ${disk_gb}G" >&2
echo "" >&2
echo "Possible causes:" >&2
echo "  - Insufficient disk space (check: df -h $DISKS_DIR)" >&2
echo "  - Permission denied (check: ls -ld $DISKS_DIR)" >&2
echo "  - Invalid size (must be > 0)" >&2
echo "" >&2
echo "Available space:" >&2
df -h "$DISKS_DIR" | tail -1 | awk '{print "  Total: " $2 ", Available: " $4}' >&2
```

**The Pattern:**
1. ❌ **What went wrong** - Clear error message
2. 📍 **Where it happened** - File, path, context
3. 🔍 **Why it might have happened** - Possible causes
4. ✅ **How to fix it** - Exact commands to run
5. 📊 **Current state** - Show relevant info

## 🎨 Interactive Guidance in Tools

### Current State: Good Foundation

**What We Have:**
- ✅ Wizards for common tasks
- ✅ Validation before execution
- ✅ Helpful error messages
- ✅ Auto-detection where possible
- ✅ Default values provided

### Vision: Even Better Guidance

**What Could Be Enhanced:**

#### 1. Setup Wizard - Progressive Disclosure
```bash
# Current: All options at once
# Future: Guide through one decision at a time

echo "Welcome to Hypervisor Setup!"
echo ""
echo "Let's get your first VM running in a few minutes."
echo ""
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "Step 1/5: Network Configuration"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "Your VMs need network access. We can set up:"
echo ""
echo "  [1] NAT Network (recommended for new users)"
echo "      ✓ Isolated from your network"
echo "      ✓ VMs have internet access"
echo "      ✓ More secure"
echo "      ✓ Easier to set up"
echo ""
echo "  [2] Bridge Network (for servers/services)"
echo "      • VMs appear on your local network"
echo "      • Accessible from other computers"
echo "      • Requires network adapter configuration"
echo ""
read -p "Your choice [1]: " NETWORK_CHOICE
NETWORK_CHOICE=${NETWORK_CHOICE:-1}
```

#### 2. VM Creation - Context-Aware Suggestions
```bash
# Detect ISO type and suggest settings
ISO_NAME=$(basename "$ISO_PATH")
if [[ "$ISO_NAME" =~ ubuntu.*desktop ]]; then
  echo "Detected: Ubuntu Desktop"
  echo "Recommended settings for good performance:"
  SUGGESTED_CPUS=2
  SUGGESTED_MEM=4096
  SUGGESTED_DISK=30
  echo "  CPUs: 2 (can run with 1, but 2+ is smoother)"
  echo "  Memory: 4096 MB (4GB - minimum for desktop)"
  echo "  Disk: 30 GB (20GB minimum, 30GB comfortable)"
elif [[ "$ISO_NAME" =~ ubuntu.*server ]]; then
  echo "Detected: Ubuntu Server"
  echo "Recommended settings:"
  SUGGESTED_CPUS=2
  SUGGESTED_MEM=2048
  SUGGESTED_DISK=20
  echo "  CPUs: 2 (1 works, 2 is better)"
  echo "  Memory: 2048 MB (2GB - sufficient for server)"
  echo "  Disk: 20 GB (minimum for comfortable use)"
fi
```

#### 3. Resource Validation - Before Problems Occur
```bash
# Check resources before creating VM
validate_resources() {
  local requested_mem=$1
  local requested_disk=$2
  
  local available_mem=$(free -m | awk '/^Mem:/{print $7}')
  local available_disk=$(df -BG "$DISKS_DIR" | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}' | tr -d 'G')
  
  # Memory check
  if [ $requested_mem -gt $available_mem ]; then
    echo "⚠ Warning: Requested memory ($requested_mem MB) exceeds available ($available_mem MB)"
    echo ""
    echo "Recommended actions:"
    echo "  1. Reduce VM memory to $((available_mem * 7 / 10)) MB (70% of available)"
    echo "  2. Close other applications to free memory"
    echo "  3. Add more RAM to your system"
    echo ""
    read -p "Continue anyway? [y/N]: " confirm
    [[ "$confirm" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]] || return 1
  fi
  
  # Disk check
  if [ $requested_disk -gt $available_disk ]; then
    echo "⚠ Warning: Requested disk ($requested_disk GB) exceeds available ($available_disk GB)"
    echo ""
    echo "Free up space with:"
    echo "  sudo nix-collect-garbage -d  # Removes old system generations"
    echo ""
    read -p "Continue anyway? [y/N]: " confirm
    [[ "$confirm" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]] || return 1
  fi
  
  return 0
}
```

#### 4. Post-Operation Guidance
```bash
# After VM creation
vm_created_successfully() {
  local vm_name=$1
  
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo "✓ VM '$vm_name' created successfully!"
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo ""
  echo "Next steps:"
  echo ""
  echo "  1. Start the VM:"
  echo "     • From menu: Select '$vm_name' → Start/Resume VM"
  echo "     • From command: virsh start $vm_name"
  echo ""
  echo "  2. Connect to console:"
  echo "     • From menu: Select '$vm_name' → Launch Console"
  echo "     • From command: remote-viewer \$(virsh domdisplay $vm_name)"
  echo ""
  echo "  3. Install the operating system"
  echo "     • Follow the OS installer in the console window"
  echo "     • Takes 10-30 minutes depending on OS"
  echo ""
  echo "  4. After installation:"
  echo "     • Remove ISO from profile for faster boots"
  echo "     • Enable autostart if desired"
  echo ""
  echo "Tip: Press any key to return to menu, or Ctrl+C to exit"
  read -n 1 -s
}
```

## 🎯 Future Enhancements for User Guidance

### Short Term (High Impact)

1. **Pre-flight Validation**
   ```bash
   # Before creating VM, check everything
   - Sufficient memory?
   - Sufficient disk space?
   - ISO verified?
   - Network configured?
   - All dependencies present?
   ```

2. **Smart Defaults in Wizards**
   ```bash
   # Auto-detect and suggest
   - CPU count based on available cores
   - Memory based on available RAM
   - Network based on host configuration
   - Storage location based on available space
   ```

3. **Progress Indicators**
   ```bash
   # Show progress for long operations
   echo "Creating disk image (20GB)..."
   pv -s ${disk_gb}G | qemu-img create -f qcow2 "$qcow" "${disk_gb}G"
   echo "✓ Disk created"
   ```

4. **Post-Operation Summaries**
   ```bash
   # After any operation, show:
   - What was done
   - What to do next
   - Common next steps
   - Where to get help
   ```

### Medium Term (Quality of Life)

5. **Interactive Tutorials**
   ```bash
   # Built-in walkthroughs
   /etc/hypervisor/scripts/tutorial.sh --first-vm
   # Guides through creating first VM interactively
   ```

6. **Configuration Wizard**
   ```bash
   # Review and adjust settings
   /etc/hypervisor/scripts/configure.sh
   # Shows current settings with explanations
   # Suggests optimizations
   ```

7. **Health Check with Auto-Fix**
   ```bash
   # Diagnose and offer to fix
   /etc/hypervisor/scripts/diagnose.sh --fix
   # Detects issues and prompts to fix them automatically
   ```

### Long Term (Advanced Guidance)

8. **Learning Mode**
   ```bash
   # Explains every command as it runs
   HYPERVISOR_LEARNING_MODE=1
   # Shows: What, Why, How for every operation
   ```

9. **Recommendation Engine**
   ```bash
   # Based on usage patterns, suggest improvements
   "You frequently start VMs manually. Would you like to enable autostart?"
   "Your VM is using 90% memory. Consider increasing allocation?"
   "ISO is still attached. Remove it for faster boot?"
   ```

10. **Assisted Troubleshooting**
    ```bash
    # Interactive problem solving
    /etc/hypervisor/scripts/troubleshoot.sh
    # Asks questions, narrows down issue, suggests fixes
    ```
