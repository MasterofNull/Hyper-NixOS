## 🎓 The Three Pillars of Your Vision

### 1. Guided User Experience ✅

**Intelligent Defaults**
```bash
# Example: Auto-detect and suggest
disk_gb=${USER_INPUT:-20}              # Default: 20GB
memory_mb=${SUGGESTED:-4096}            # Suggested based on available
cpus=${DETECTED:-2}                     # Based on available cores
network=${NETWORK_TYPE:-default}        # NAT by default (secure)
```

**Helpful Suggestions**
```bash
# Example: Recommendations in context
$DIALOG --yesno "Enable strict firewall?\n\n\
Recommended: Yes (secure)\n\
Your system will be protected by default" 10 70
```

**Clear Hints**
```bash
# Example: Descriptive labels everywhere
"2" "Launch Console (SPICE/VNC)" 
"5" "Stop VM (graceful shutdown)"
"7" "Delete VM (with confirmation)"
```

**Provided Data**
```bash
# Example: Show current state
echo "Available RAM: ${available_ram}MB"
echo "Recommended for VMs: $(( available_ram * 7 / 10 ))MB"
echo "Free disk space: $(df -h $DISKS_DIR | ...)"
```

**Actionable Errors**
```bash
# Example: Complete error messages
echo "Error: Failed to create disk" >&2
echo "  Reason: Insufficient space" >&2
echo "  Available: 5GB, Required: 20GB" >&2
echo "" >&2
echo "To fix: sudo nix-collect-garbage -d" >&2
```

### 2. Transparent Processes ✅

**Show What's Happening**
```bash
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "Creating Virtual Disk"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "What we're doing:"
echo "  • Creating qcow2 disk image"
echo "  • Path: /var/lib/hypervisor/disks/vm.qcow2"
echo "  • Format: qcow2 (grows as needed)"
echo ""
echo "Why this format:"
echo "  • Efficient (only uses space actually needed)"
echo "  • Supports snapshots"
echo "  • Better performance"
```

**Explain Choices**
```bash
echo "📚 About NAT vs Bridge Networking:"
echo ""
echo "NAT (recommended):"
echo "  • VMs isolated from your network"
echo "  • Automatic IP assignment"
echo "  • More secure"
echo "  • Best for: Testing, development"
echo ""
echo "Bridge:"
echo "  • VMs appear on your network"
echo "  • Accessible from other computers"
echo "  • Best for: Servers, production"
```

**Preview Actions**
```bash
echo "Configuration Preview:"
echo ""
echo "We will apply:"
echo "  • Strict firewall: enabled"
echo "  • Hugepages: 2048MB reserved"
echo "  • AppArmor: enabled"
echo ""
echo "Files to be created:"
echo "  • /etc/hypervisor/configuration/security-local.nix"
echo ""
read -p "Continue? [Y/n]: " confirm
```

### 3. Educational Approach ✅

**Teach As You Go**
```bash
echo "📚 About VM Disks:"
echo "  Virtual machines use disk image files."
echo "  We use qcow2 format because:"
echo "    • Takes only space actually used"
echo "    • Supports snapshots"
echo "    • Better performance"
echo ""
echo "💡 Tip: The VM sees a ${size}GB disk, but"
echo "   it only uses host space as files are written."
```

**Build Mental Models**
```bash
echo "Think of networking like buildings:"
echo ""
echo "NAT = Apartments in a building"
echo "  🏢 Shared internet (building's connection)"
echo "  🔒 Private (can't directly reach from outside)"
echo ""
echo "Bridge = Houses on a street"
echo "  🏠 Individual addresses"
echo "  👥 Anyone can visit"
```

**Explain Impact**
```bash
echo "Impact of your choice:"
echo ""
echo "Immediately:"
echo "  • Network 'default' will be created"
echo ""
echo "When you create VMs:"
echo "  • VMs get IPs like 192.168.122.X"
echo "  • Can access internet"
echo "  • Isolated from local network"
echo ""
echo "You can change this later:"
echo "  • Edit VM profile: network.bridge"
```

## 🎨 Design Patterns Established

### 1. The "What → Why → How → Result" Pattern
Every operation follows this structure:
1. **What** - Describe what's being done
2. **Why** - Explain why it matters
3. **How** - Show the steps
4. **Result** - Summarize outcome and next steps

### 2. The "Teach by Analogy" Pattern
Complex concepts explained with real-world comparisons:
- NAT = Apartment building
- Bridge = Houses on a street
- vCPUs = Restaurant kitchen staff
- RAM = Workspace available

### 3. The "Preview Before Action" Pattern
Always show what will happen before doing it:
- List files to be created
- Show settings to be applied
- Explain impact on system
- Request confirmation

### 4. The "Educational Error" Pattern
Turn failures into learning:
- What went wrong (clear message)
- Why it happened (diagnosis)
- How to fix it (exact commands)
- How to prevent it (guidance)

### 5. The "Guided Discovery" Pattern
Let users discover their system:
- Check hardware capabilities
- Explain what was found
- Suggest optimal settings
- Show how to adjust later
