## 🎯 Gaps Preventing 10/10

### Critical Gaps (Must Fix for 9.5)

#### 1. **No Automated Testing** (Impact: HIGH)
**Problem:**
- All testing is manual
- No regression testing
- Breaking changes not caught early
- Quality relies on manual validation

**Solution:**
```bash
tests/
├── integration/
│   ├── test_installation.sh        # Test bootstrap process
│   ├── test_vm_lifecycle.sh        # Test VM create/start/stop
│   ├── test_network_bridge.sh     # Test bridge setup
│   └── test_security_model.sh     # Test polkit rules
├── unit/
│   ├── test_health_check.sh       # Test health check script
│   ├── test_preflight.sh          # Test validation
│   └── test_backup.sh             # Test backup/restore
└── ci/
    ├── .github/workflows/test.yml  # CI pipeline
    └── nix-shell-test.sh          # Test in clean env
```

**Benefit:** Catch bugs before users, ensure quality, enable confident changes

---

#### 2. **No Web Dashboard** (Impact: MEDIUM)
**Problem:**
- Console-only interface
- No visual metrics
- No remote management from phone/tablet
- Harder for less technical users

**Solution:**
```
Web Dashboard (Port 8080):
├── Overview
│   ├── System Health (CPU, RAM, disk)
│   ├── Running VMs (status, uptime)
│   └── Recent Alerts
├── VM Management
│   ├── List VMs (with thumbnails/screenshots)
│   ├── Start/Stop/Restart buttons
│   ├── Console access (noVNC)
│   └── Resource graphs (per-VM)
├── ISO Library
│   ├── Available ISOs
│   ├── Download progress
│   └── Upload custom ISO
├── System
│   ├── Health check results
│   ├── Backup status
│   ├── Update notifications
│   └── Security alerts
└── Settings
    ├── Network configuration
    ├── Security settings
    └── Backup schedule
```

**Technologies:**
- Backend: Python Flask/FastAPI or Go
- Frontend: Simple HTML/JS (no heavy frameworks)
- Auth: Same as SSH keys + session tokens
- Read-only for operator, full access for admin

**Benefit:** Modern management, remote access, easier for beginners

---

#### 3. **No Alerting System** (Impact: MEDIUM)
**Problem:**
- Health checks run but no notifications
- Must manually check logs
- Can't respond to issues quickly
- No integration with existing alerting

**Solution:**
```nix
# configuration/alerting.nix
{
  services.hypervisor-alerts = {
    enable = true;
    
    # Email notifications
    email = {
      enable = true;
      smtp = "smtp.gmail.com:587";
      from = "hypervisor@example.com";
      to = [ "admin@example.com" ];
      tls = true;
    };
    
    # Webhook notifications (Slack, Discord, Teams)
    webhooks = [
      "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK"
    ];
    
    # Alert rules
    rules = [
      {
        name = "VM Down";
        condition = "vm_state != running";
        severity = "critical";
        cooldown = "5m";
      }
      {
        name = "Low Disk Space";
        condition = "disk_usage > 85%";
        severity = "warning";
        cooldown = "1h";
      }
      {
        name = "High CPU";
        condition = "cpu_usage > 90% for 5m";
        severity = "warning";
        cooldown = "15m";
      }
    ];
  };
}
```

**Benefit:** Proactive issue response, less downtime, peace of mind

---

### Important Gaps (Needed for 9.7)

#### 4. **No Backup Verification** (Impact: MEDIUM)
**Problem:**
- Backups created but never tested
- Don't know if restores will work
- False sense of security

**Solution:**
```bash
# scripts/verify_backups.sh
- Automatically restore backup to temp location
- Verify VM boots successfully
- Check file integrity
- Generate verification report
- Alert if backup is corrupt

# Run weekly via systemd timer
```

**Benefit:** Confidence in disaster recovery, catch corruption early

---

#### 5. **No Metrics Visualization** (Impact: MEDIUM)
**Problem:**
- Metrics collected (hourly) but stored as JSON
- No graphs or trends
- Can't see historical patterns
- Hard to capacity plan

**Solution:**
```
Lightweight Metrics Stack:
- Keep collecting metrics (already done)
- Add simple graphing:
  - Option 1: Built-in web dashboard (see #2)
  - Option 2: Export to InfluxDB + Grafana
  - Option 3: Simple HTML page with Chart.js

Display:
- CPU usage over time
- RAM usage trends
- Disk growth rate
- VM resource consumption
- Network throughput
```

**Benefit:** Trend analysis, capacity planning, performance optimization

---

#### 6. **No CI/CD Pipeline** (Impact: LOW for users, HIGH for development)
**Problem:**
- Manual testing before releases
- No automated quality gates
- Slower development cycle

**Solution:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Test & Release
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install NixOS
      - name: Run bootstrap
      - name: Test VM creation
      - name: Test security model
      - name: Run health check
      
  release:
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    steps:
      - name: Create tarball
      - name: Generate checksums
      - name: Create GitHub release
```

**Benefit:** Faster releases, fewer bugs, contributor confidence

---

### Nice-to-Have Gaps (For 9.8-10.0)

#### 7. **No Live Migration** (Impact: LOW)
**Problem:**
- Can't move running VMs between hosts
- Downtime for hardware maintenance
- No load balancing

**Solution:**
- Integrate libvirt live migration
- Shared storage requirement
- Network configuration
- Migration wizard

**Complexity:** High  
**User Need:** Low (most users have single host)  
**Priority:** Low

---

#### 8. **No Multi-Tenancy** (Impact: LOW)
**Problem:**
- One operator user
- Can't have multiple isolated users
- No per-user VM quotas

**Solution:**
- Multiple operator users with separate VM pools
- Resource quotas per user
- Billing/accounting integration
- User management interface

**Complexity:** High  
**User Need:** Low (most deployments single-user)  
**Priority:** Low

---

#### 9. **No Installer ISO** (Impact: MEDIUM)
**Problem:**
- Must install base NixOS first
- Then run bootstrap
- Two-step process

**Solution:**
- Create Hyper-NixOS installer ISO
- Boot → Automatic installation
- Hardware detection
- One-step deployment

**Complexity:** Medium  
**User Need:** Medium (convenience)  
**Priority:** Medium

---

#### 10. **No Plugin System** (Impact: LOW)
**Problem:**
- All features built-in
- Can't extend without modifying code
- No third-party integrations

**Solution:**
```
Plugin Architecture:
- Hooks for VM lifecycle events
- Custom menu items
- Additional health checks
- Custom backup targets
- Integration modules

Example:
  plugins/
  ├── aws-backup/       # Backup to S3
  ├── discord-notify/   # Discord notifications
  └── prometheus-exporter/  # Metrics export
```

**Complexity:** High  
**User Need:** Low (current features sufficient)  
**Priority:** Low
