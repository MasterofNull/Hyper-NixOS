# Security Countermeasures Analysis Based on Advanced Offensive Capabilities

## Network Attack Tools â†’ Required Defenses

### 1. **Network Scanning (nmap, masscan, zmap)**
**Countermeasures:**
- [ ] IDS/IPS with port scan detection
- [ ] Rate limiting on connection attempts
- [ ] Honeypots for deception
- [ ] Log aggregation and alerting on scan patterns
- [ ] Network segmentation to limit scan scope

### 2. **Password Attacks (hashcat, john, hydra)**
**Countermeasures:**
- [ ] Strong password policies (complexity, length)
- [ ] Account lockout policies
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- [ ] Password hash monitoring
- [ ] Privileged access management (PAM)
- [ ] Detection of brute force attempts

### 3. **Web Application Testing (Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, sqlmap)**
**Countermeasures:**
- [ ] Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] CSRF tokens
- [ ] Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Regular security scanning
- [ ] Parameterized queries for SQL injection prevention

### 4. **Network Sniffing (Wireshark, tcpdump, ettercap)**
**Countermeasures:**
- [ ] Network encryption (TLS/SSL everywhere)
- [ ] Network segmentation and VLANs
- [ ] 802.1X network authentication
- [ ] Detection of ARP spoofing
- [ ] Encrypted protocols for sensitive data

### 5. **Exploitation Frameworks (Metasploit, Empire, Cobalt Strike)**
**Countermeasures:**
- [ ] Patch management system
- [ ] Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
- [ ] Application whitelisting
- [ ] Behavioral analysis
- [ ] Memory protection (ASLR, DEP)
- [ ] Regular vulnerability assessments

### 6. **Proxy and Tunneling (proxychains, tor, redsocks)**
**Countermeasures:**
- [ ] Deep packet inspection
- [ ] Proxy detection mechanisms
- [ ] Tor exit node blocking (if required)
- [ ] Anomaly detection for tunneled traffic
- [ ] Data loss prevention (DLP) systems

### 7. **Docker/Container Attacks**
**Countermeasures:**
- [ ] Container runtime security (Falco, Sysdig)
- [ ] Image vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Least privilege containers
- [ ] Network policies for containers
- [ ] Secrets management
- [ ] Container escape detection
