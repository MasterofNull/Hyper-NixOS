# Project Reorganization Report - 2025-10-14

## Overview
Reorganized the Hyper-NixOS project structure according to the system design documentation, moving files into their correct folders and updating all references.

## Files Moved

- `security-tool-deployment.py` → `scripts/deployment/`
- `prepare-for-shipping.sh` → `scripts/deployment/`

### Automation Scripts
- `incident-response-automation.py` → `scripts/automation/`

### General Scripts
- `console-enhancements.sh` → `scripts/`
- `profile-selector.sh` → `scripts/`

### Binary Commands
- `sec`, `check`, `scan`, `vuln` → `scripts/bin/`
- `sec-check`, `sec-comply`, `sec-scan` → `scripts/bin/`

### Documentation
- `CORRECTED-IP-CLASSIFICATION.md` → `docs/ip-protection/`
- `FINAL-IP-CLASSIFICATION.md` → `docs/ip-protection/`
- `IP-PROTECTION-GUIDE.md` → `docs/ip-protection/`
- `SIMPLE-IP-PROTECTION.md` → `docs/ip-protection/`
- `SHIPPING-SUMMARY.md` → `docs/deployment/`
- `AUDIT-RESULTS.md` → `docs/reports/`

### Configuration Files
- `module-config-schema.yaml` → `config/`

## References Updated

### Script Path Updates
1. Updated all references to `security-platform-deploy.sh` to `scripts/deployment/security-platform-deploy.sh`
2. Updated all references to `modular-security-framework.sh` to `scripts/security/framework/modular-security-framework.sh`
3. Updated all references to `defensive-validation.sh` to `scripts/security/defensive-validation.sh`
4. Updated all references to `audit-platform.sh` to `scripts/audit/audit-platform.sh`
5. Updated all references to `security-control.sh` to `scripts/security/security-control.sh`

### Fixed Path Issues
- Fixed `security-setup.sh` script paths - changed from `$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts/...` to `$SCRIPT_DIR/../...`
- Added conditional checks for file existence before copying

## Structure Benefits

1. **Organized by Function**: Scripts are now organized by their primary function (security, setup, monitoring, etc.)
2. **Clear Hierarchy**: Related scripts are grouped together
3. **No Root Clutter**: Root directory now only contains essential NixOS configuration files
4. **Consistent Paths**: All script references have been updated to reflect new locations
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Development scripts separate from distribution (public-release folder)

## Duplicate Management

The `public-release` directory contains distribution copies of scripts. This is intentional for:
- Creating release packages
- Maintaining a clean distribution structure
- Separating development from production releases

## Next Steps

1. Update any CI/CD pipelines to use new script locations
2. Update documentation that references old script paths
3. Consider creating symlinks in `/usr/local/bin` for commonly used commands
4. Update any systemd service files that reference old paths
