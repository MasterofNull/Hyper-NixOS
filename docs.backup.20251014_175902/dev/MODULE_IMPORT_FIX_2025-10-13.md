# Module Import Fix - October 13, 2025

## Issue Description
Build error encountered: `error: getting status of '/nix/store/2xvz8x3av53s98c31vszhl3frn5w1aw0-source/modules/core/base.nix': No such file or directory`

## Root Cause Analysis
The configuration files (configuration.nix, configuration-complete.nix, configuration-privilege-separation.nix) were attempting to import modules that didn't exist in the codebase:

1. **Missing Core Module**: `modules/core/base.nix` - This file never existed
2. **Missing Directories**: 
   - `modules/networking/` - Entire directory was missing
   - `modules/services/` - Entire directory was missing
3. **Missing Files in Existing Directories**:
   - `modules/virtualization/qemu.nix` - Directory exists but file was missing

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Core Module Fix
Replaced the non-existent `modules/core/base.nix` with two existing modules:
- `modules/core/system.nix` - Contains basic system settings
- `modules/core/packages.nix` - Contains core package definitions

### 2. Security Module Addition
Added import for `modules/security/base.nix` which contains the libvirt security configuration that was expected to be in the core base module.

### 3. Virtualization Module Fix
Replaced `modules/virtualization/qemu.nix` with the existing `modules/virtualization/performance.nix`.

### 4. Networking and Services
Removed all imports for:
- `modules/networking/base.nix`
- `modules/networking/bridges.nix`
- `modules/services/ssh.nix`
- `modules/services/monitoring.nix`

These configurations are already handled directly within the main configuration files, so separate modules weren't necessary.

## Files Modified
1. `configuration.nix`
2. `configuration-complete.nix`
3. `configuration-privilege-separation.nix`

## Verification
All module imports were verified to exist using:
```bash
grep -h "^\s*\./modules/" configuration.nix configuration-*.nix | sort -u | \
while read -r line; do 
  module=$(echo "$line" | sed 's/^\s*//' | sed 's/;.*//'); 
  if [[ -f "$module" ]]; then 
    echo "✓ EXISTS: $module"; 
  else 
    echo "✗ MISSING: $module"; 
  fi; 
done
```

All imports now point to existing files.

## Lessons Learned
1. Always verify that imported modules actually exist before committing
2. Module organization should be documented to prevent confusion
3. If functionality is embedded in main configs, don't create empty module imports

## Process Improvement
This fix highlighted the critical importance of updating AI documentation before any push/merge. A process failure occurred where the fix was committed without updating the AI_ASSISTANT_CONTEXT.md file, which could have led to future confusion and repeated errors.

Going forward, ALL changes must include documentation updates as part of the commit process.
