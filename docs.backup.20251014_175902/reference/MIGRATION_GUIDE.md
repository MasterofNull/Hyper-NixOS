# Migration Guide: First-Boot Wizard ‚Üí Install VMs Workflow

## For Existing Users

If you're upgrading from a previous version of Hyper-NixOS, here's what's changed and how to adapt.

## What Changed?

### Before (v2.0)
- **First boot:** Automatic wizard runs once
- **Subsequent boots:** Main menu with separate tools
- **VM creation:** Multiple scattered tools

### After (v2.1)
- **All boots:** Main menu immediately
- **VM creation:** Single "Install VMs" workflow
- **Better UX:** Integrated, guided, can exit anytime

## Impact on Your System

### ‚úÖ No Breaking Changes
- **Existing VMs:** Work exactly as before
- **Network config:** Unchanged
- **ISOs:** All still available
- **Scripts:** Individual tools still accessible

### üìù Changed Defaults
- **First-boot wizard:** Disabled by default
- **Menu option:** New "Install VMs" workflow available
- **Boot behavior:** Console menu loads directly

## What You Need to Do

### Option 1: Nothing (Recommended)
Your system continues to work. The first-boot wizard is simply disabled. Use "Install VMs" workflow when you need to create new VMs.

### Option 2: Re-enable First-Boot Wizard (Not Recommended)
If you really want the old behavior:

```bash
# Edit local config
sudo nano /var/lib/hypervisor/configuration/boot-local.nix
```

Add:
```nix
{ config, lib, ... }:
{
  hypervisor.firstBootWizard.enableAtBoot = true;
}
```

Rebuild:
```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake "/etc/hypervisor#$(hostname -s)"
```

**Note:** We recommend using the new "Install VMs" workflow instead. It provides better UX and can be run anytime from the menu.

## How to Use the New Workflow

## FAQ

### Q: Will my existing VMs work?
**A:** Yes! No changes to VM definitions or runtime behavior.

### Q: Do I need to reconfigure networking?
**A:** No. Existing network bridges continue to work.

### Q: What happens to my ISOs?
**A:** They're all still in `/var/lib/hypervisor/isos/` and work perfectly.

### Q: Can I still use the first-boot wizard?
**A:** Yes, but it must be run manually:
```bash
sudo bash /etc/hypervisor/scripts/setup_wizard.sh
```

However, we recommend trying the new "Install VMs" workflow first.

### Q: Why disable the first-boot wizard?
**A:** User feedback showed:
- Confusion when wizard exits
- Hard to re-run if needed
- Scattered tools after wizard
- No easy "start over"

The new workflow addresses all these issues:
- Always accessible from menu
- Can exit/resume anytime
- Integrated experience
- Repeatable process

### Q: What if I don't like the new workflow?
**A:** 
1. Try it a few times - it's significantly improved
2. Use individual tools if preferred (they're all still there)
3. Provide feedback: https://github.com/MasterofNull/Hyper-NixOS/issues

### Q: How do I uninstall this update?
**A:** To rollback to previous configuration:
```bash
# List generations
sudo nix-env --list-generations --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system

# Rollback to previous (e.g., 42)
sudo nix-env --rollback --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system
sudo /nix/var/nix/profiles/system/bin/switch-to-configuration switch
```
