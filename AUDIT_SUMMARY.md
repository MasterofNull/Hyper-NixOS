### What's Working Great ‚úÖ

1. **Security (5/5)** - Hardened kernel, AppArmor, non-root QEMU, strict firewall options
2. **Feature Completeness (4.5/5)** - VFIO, SEV/SNP, CET, CPU pinning, hugepages, multi-arch
3. **Advanced User Flexibility (5/5)** - Full NixOS customization, direct JSON editing, Rust tools
4. **VM Isolation (5/5)** - Systemd slices, network zones, AppArmor, namespaces, seccomp

### What Needs Work ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Novice User Experience (3/5)** - Documentation lacks beginner-friendly guides and troubleshooting
2. **Day-to-Day Operations (3/5)** - No VM dashboard, limited monitoring, manual workflows
3. **Testing (1/5)** - No automated test suite, no CI/CD
4. **Monitoring (2/5)** - Stub implementations only

## Key Recommendations

### For Novice Users

**DO THIS:**
1. **Expand `docs/quickstart.txt`** to 200+ lines with:
   - Step-by-step instructions with expected output
   - Screenshots or ASCII diagrams
   - Troubleshooting for each step
   - Common issues and fixes

2. **Add diagnostic command** that checks:
   - KVM availability
   - Libvirt status  
   - Disk space
   - Network bridges
   - Recent errors

3. **Improve error messages** with:
   - What went wrong
   - Why it happened
   - How to fix it (specific commands)
   - Where to get more help

**Example:**
```
Current: "Error: Failed to create VM"

Better: "Error: Failed to create VM 'ubuntu-test'
 Reason: Insufficient disk space in /var/lib/hypervisor/disks
 Available: 2.1 GB, Required: 20 GB
 
 How to fix:
 1. Free up space: sudo nix-collect-garbage -d
 2. Use different location: Edit profile's disk_path  
 3. Reduce disk size: Set disk_gb to 10 in profile
 
 For help: Run 'diagnose.sh' or check docs/troubleshooting.md"
```

### For Security

**DO THIS:**
1. **Per-VM AppArmor profiles** - Currently one profile for all VMs
2. **Secrets management** - Integrate sops-nix for sensitive VM data
3. **Firewall persistence** - Use nftables declaratively, not iptables
4. **ISO verification enforcement** - Require checksum validation
5. **Audit log retention** - Define and implement policy

### For Reliability  

**DO THIS:**
1. **Automated testing:**
   - ShellCheck on all scripts (catches 90% of bash bugs)
   - Unit tests for critical functions
   - Integration tests for VM lifecycle
   - CI/CD with GitHub Actions

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Complete `prom_exporter.sh` 
   - Add Grafana dashboard configs
   - Alert on VM failures and resource exhaustion

3. **Better logging:**
   - Structured logging with levels
   - Log aggregation
   - Automatic log rotation
