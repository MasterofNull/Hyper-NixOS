# Warnings & Caveats

- VFIO can make devices unavailable to the host; ensure out-of-band access.
- GPG verification requires vendor keys; we auto-fetch heuristically but validate results.
- Snapshots and backups can impact performance; keep sufficient disk space.
- Bridge reconfiguration can interrupt networking; apply during maintenance windows.
