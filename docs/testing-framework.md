# Testing Framework Recommendations

## Current Testing
- Manual validation scripts
- Basic health checks
- Ad-hoc testing procedures

## Proposed Testing Framework

### 1. Unit Tests
```bash
# Test individual components
- VM profile validation
- Configuration parsing
- Network setup scripts
- Security policy enforcement
```

### 2. Integration Tests
```bash
# Test component interactions
- VM lifecycle (create, start, stop, destroy)
- Network connectivity between VMs
- Storage operations (snapshots, backups)
- Migration procedures
```

### 3. Security Tests
```bash
# Validate security measures
- AppArmor policy enforcement
- Network isolation verification
- Privilege escalation prevention
- Resource limit enforcement
```

### 4. Performance Tests
```bash
# Benchmark performance
- VM startup times
- Network throughput
- Disk I/O performance
- Memory allocation efficiency
```

### 5. Automated Testing Pipeline
```yaml
# CI/CD integration
stages:
  - syntax_validation
  - unit_tests
  - integration_tests
  - security_tests
  - performance_benchmarks
  - deployment_tests
```

## Implementation Plan
1. Start with critical path testing (VM lifecycle)
2. Add security validation tests
3. Implement performance benchmarking
4. Create automated test runner
5. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
