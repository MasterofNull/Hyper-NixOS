Per-VM Firewall

- Use Per-VM firewall in More Options to open inbound TCP/UDP ports for a VM.
- The tool targets the VM IP (if known) or the VMâ€™s bridge as a fallback.
- Rules are applied to the host iptables FORWARD chain.

Tips
- Prefer targeting specific VM IPs. Ensure VMs obtain an IP (cloud-init or DHCP).
- Consider making persistent rules via your host firewall configuration.
