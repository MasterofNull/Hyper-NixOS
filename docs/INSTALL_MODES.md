## 🎯 Which Mode Should I Use?

### ✨ Standard Install (Default)
```bash
--hostname "$(hostname -s)" --action switch
```

**Choose if:**
- First time installing NixOS hypervisor
- Want GUI immediately available
- Have good internet (>50 Mbps)
- Not in a hurry
- Want hardened kernel from start

**You get:**
- GNOME desktop environment
- Hardened Linux kernel
- All monitoring tools
- virt-manager GUI
- Full documentation
- Complete security hardening

**Time:** ~30 minutes | **Size:** ~3 GB

---

### ⚡ Fast Install (Recommended)
```bash
--fast --hostname "$(hostname -s)" --action switch
```

**Choose if:**
- Want same features as Standard
- On slower internet connection
- Value time over bandwidth
- Still want GUI

**You get:**
- **Everything from Standard mode**
- 25 parallel downloads (vs 1)
- Optimized binary cache
- Skip unnecessary rebuilds
- HTTP/2 optimization

**Differences from Standard:**
- **Speed:** 50% faster downloads
- **Features:** Identical (nothing removed)
- **Quality:** Same

**Time:** ~15 minutes | **Size:** ~2 GB

---

### 🚀 Minimal Install (Fastest)
```bash
--fast --minimal --hostname "$(hostname -s)" --action switch
```

**Choose if:**
- Deploying to many systems
- Very slow internet (<10 Mbps)
- Headless server (no GUI needed)
- Want to customize later
- Testing/development

**You get:**
- QEMU + KVM + libvirt (core hypervisor)
- Console menu (TUI interface)
- VM management scripts
- ISO download/verification
- Security hardening
- Automation (health checks, backups)
- Full documentation

**NOT included initially:**
- ❌ GNOME desktop
- ❌ virt-manager GUI
- ❌ Hardened kernel (uses standard)
- ❌ AppArmor
- ❌ Some monitoring tools

**Can add later:**
```bash
# Enable GUI (takes 5-10 min)
echo '{ hypervisor.gui.enableAtBoot = true; }' | \
  sudo tee /var/lib/hypervisor/configuration/enable-gui.nix
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake "/etc/hypervisor#$(hostname -s)"
```

**Time:** ~13 minutes | **Size:** ~1.5 GB

## 📊 Detailed Breakdown

### Standard Install
**What happens:**
1. Downloads all packages (GNOME, hardened kernel, tools)
2. Builds system with standard settings
3. Generates documentation
4. Single-threaded downloads
5. Complete verification

**Package highlights:**
- GNOME + GDM
- virt-manager (GUI VM manager)
- looking-glass-client
- All monitoring tools
- Hardened kernel packages
- Full documentation

**Result:**
- GUI available at boot
- Can switch between console menu and desktop
- All features immediately available
- Maximum compatibility

---

### Fast Install (`--fast`)
**What happens:**
1. Downloads packages with 25 parallel connections
2. Skips flake lock updates
3. Uses HTTP/2 for speed
4. Maximum CPU parallelism
5. Otherwise identical to Standard

**Optimizations:**
- `http-connections = 25` (vs 1)
- `max-jobs = auto` (use all cores)
- `cores = 0` (max parallelism per job)
- HTTP/2 enabled
- 3 retry attempts

**Result:**
- Same final system as Standard
- Takes half the time
- Uses less bandwidth (better compression)
- No quality tradeoffs

---

### Minimal Install (`--fast --minimal`)
**What happens:**
1. Uses Fast mode optimizations
2. Imports `minimal-bootstrap.nix`
3. Skips GNOME packages (~500 MB saved)
4. Uses standard kernel (smaller)
5. Disables doc generation (faster build)
6. Still includes security essentials

**Package differences:**
```
Standard/Fast:          Minimal:
- GNOME (500+ MB)       ✅ No GUI packages
- Hardened kernel       ✅ Standard kernel
- virt-manager          ❌ Not included
- looking-glass         ❌ Not included
- All monitoring        ⚠️ Core monitoring only
- Documentation         ❌ Skips man pages*
```
*Documentation files still available, just not installed man pages

**Result:**
- Fastest possible install
- Smallest download
- Console-only initially
- Add features incrementally

## 🔄 Upgrading Between Modes

### Minimal → Standard
```bash
# Remove minimal config
sudo rm /var/lib/hypervisor/configuration/minimal-bootstrap.nix

# Enable full features
cat | sudo tee /var/lib/hypervisor/configuration/enable-features.nix << 'EOF'
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }: {
  hypervisor.gui.enableAtBoot = true;
  boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_hardened;
  security.apparmor.enable = true;
  documentation.enable = true;
}
EOF

# Rebuild (takes 5-10 min, ~500 MB download)
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake "/etc/hypervisor#$(hostname -s)"
```

### No downgrade needed
Fast and Standard produce identical systems, so there's nothing to "downgrade."

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Slow Internet (<10 Mbps)
```bash
# Use minimal mode
--fast --minimal

# Then add features one at a time
# 1. Add GUI when ready (later)
# 2. Enable hardened kernel (later)
# 3. Install monitoring tools (later)
```

### For Multiple Deployments
```bash
# First system: Use Standard or Fast
# Creates local binary cache

# Other systems: Set up cache server
nix-serve --port 5000

# On other systems: Point to cache
# Install is 90% faster (local network)
```

### For Testing
```bash
# Use minimal for quick iterations
--fast --minimal

# Test your changes
# Rebuild is <2 minutes

# When satisfied, upgrade to full
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does Minimal mode skip security features?**  
A: No. Core security (audit, SSH hardening, firewall) is included. Only optional features like AppArmor are delayed.

**Q: Can I use Fast mode in production?**  
A: Yes! Fast mode produces identical systems to Standard, just faster. It's actually recommended.

**Q: How long does it take to add GUI after Minimal?**  
A: About 5-10 minutes and ~500 MB download.

**Q: Does Minimal mode skip automation?**  
A: No. Health checks, backups, and monitoring are always included.

**Q: Which uses less bandwidth overall?**  
A: If you eventually want GUI, Fast mode is better (2 GB total). If you never want GUI, Minimal is better (1.5 GB).

**Q: Can I switch modes after install?**  
A: Not exactly. But you can add/remove features at any time. NixOS makes this safe and easy.
