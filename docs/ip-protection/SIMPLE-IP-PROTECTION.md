## What Goes Where

### Private IP (Not for Distribution):
- AI-Development-Best-Practices.md
- AI-LESSONS-LEARNED.md
- AI-QUICK-REFERENCE.md
- All audit scripts (audit-platform.sh, test-*.sh)
- All implementation reports
- Development methodology docs
- Architecture decision records
- Internal test results

### Public (Safe to Share):
- README.md
- User quick start guides
- Basic deployment guides
- Core platform scripts
- General documentation

## Simple .gitignore

```gitignore
# Private IP Content
private-ip/
**/AI-*.md
**/audit-*.sh
**/test-*.sh
**/*IMPLEMENTATION*.md
**/*LESSONS-LEARNED*
```

## For Cursor AI Access

Simply keep the private-ip/ folder in your workspace. Cursor can access it while you're working, but it won't be included in any public distributions.

## Manual Process

1. Keep private IP docs in `private-ip/` folder
2. Keep public content in `public/` folder  
3. When sharing, only share contents of `public/`
4. Never commit `private-ip/` to public repos
