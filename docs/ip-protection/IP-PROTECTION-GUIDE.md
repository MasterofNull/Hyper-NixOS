# IP Protection Guide - With Cursor AI Access

## Overview

This protection system secures your intellectual property (AI documentation, audit tools, implementation details) while maintaining seamless access for Cursor AI when you're using it.

## Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Protection (One Time)
```bash
# Run the Cursor-friendly protection setup
./setup-cursor-friendly-protection.sh

# This creates all necessary scripts and configurations
```

### 2. Activate Protection
```bash
# Run the main protection script
./protect-with-cursor-access.sh
```

This will:
- Move private IP content to `.private-ip/` (hidden directory)
- Create Cursor AI accessible links in `.cursor-ip-links/`
- Generate a clean `public-release/` directory
- Set up access controls and monitoring

### 3. Verify Cursor Access
```bash
# Check that Cursor AI can still access your content
./verify-cursor-access.sh
```

## Directory Structure After Protection

```
workspace/
├── .private-ip/              # Your protected IP content (700 permissions)
│   ├── ai-docs/             # AI development documentation
│   ├── audit-tools/         # Audit and test scripts
│   └── implementation/      # Implementation details
│
├── .cursor-ip-links/        # Symlinks for Cursor AI access
│   ├── AI-Development-Best-Practices.md -> ../.private-ip/ai-docs/...
│   ├── AI-LESSONS-LEARNED.md -> ../.private-ip/ai-docs/...
│   └── PRIVATE-INDEX.md     # Index for Cursor navigation
│
├── public-release/          # Safe for public distribution
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── security-platform-deploy.sh
│   └── docs/               # Public documentation only
│
└── [protection scripts]     # The protection system itself
```

## How It Works

### For You (Owner)
- Full access to all content in `.private-ip/`
- Can run all protection and access scripts
- Can grant access to other users if needed

### For Cursor AI
- Automatically detected through:
  - Environment variables (`CURSOR_EDITOR`, `CURSOR_AI_SESSION`)
  - Process detection (parent process check)
  - Workspace markers (`.cursor-workspace`)
- Access provided through symlinks in `.cursor-ip-links/`
- Can read and analyze your private documentation
- Activity is excluded from access monitoring

### For Others
- Can only access `public-release/` content
- Cannot see or access `.private-ip/` (hidden + protected)
- Access attempts are logged and monitored
- Must have explicit authorization file to access private content

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Access Control
The `smart-access-control.sh` script automatically detects if access is from:
- Cursor AI (allowed)
- Authorized user (allowed)
- Unauthorized access (blocked)

### 2. Clean Public Releases
```bash
# Create a public release without IP content
./prepare-public-release.sh

# This creates public-release/ with only safe content
# Then: tar -czf security-platform-public.tar.gz -C public-release .
```

### 3. Monitoring (Cursor-Aware)
```bash
# Monitor access excluding Cursor AI activity
./monitor-excluding-cursor.sh

# This logs only non-Cursor access attempts
```

## Managing Access

### Grant Access to Another User
```bash
# As owner, grant access to a specific user
./control-access.sh grant username
```

### Revoke Access
```bash
# Remove authorization file
sudo rm /home/username/.security-platform-auth
```

### Encrypt Private Content (Extra Security)
```bash
# Encrypt all private content
cd .private-ip
./encrypt-content.sh

# This creates an encrypted archive
# Decrypt with: openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in private-content.enc | tar -xzf -
```

## Important Notes

1. **Backup Your Private Content**: Always maintain secure backups of `.private-ip/`

2. **Git Considerations**: The system creates `.gitignore` files to prevent accidental commits

3. **Cursor AI Sessions**: Cursor AI access is automatic when you're using the editor

4. **Public Distributions**: Always use `public-release/` for sharing, never the root directory

5. **License**: A restrictive license is created to protect your IP legally

## Troubleshooting

### Cursor AI Can't Access Content
```bash
# Run verification
./verify-cursor-access.sh

# If issues, recreate Cursor links
./organize-private-content.sh
```

### Need to Update Private Content
```bash
# Add new private file
cp new-private-doc.md .private-ip/ai-docs/

# Create Cursor link
ln -sf .private-ip/ai-docs/new-private-doc.md .cursor-ip-links/
```

### Creating Fresh Public Release
```bash
# Remove old release
rm -rf public-release/

# Create new one
./prepare-public-release.sh
```

## Summary

Your intellectual property is now:
- ✅ Protected from unauthorized access
- ✅ Hidden from public view
- ✅ Still accessible to Cursor AI when you're using it
- ✅ Cleanly separated from public content
- ✅ Monitored for unauthorized access
- ✅ Legally protected with restrictive license

The system provides the best of both worlds: strong IP protection with convenient Cursor AI access for your development work.
