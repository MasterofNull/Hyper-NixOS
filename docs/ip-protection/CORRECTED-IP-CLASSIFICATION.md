# Corrected IP Classification

## PRIVATE IP (AI Context Documents Only)
These are your proprietary AI training/context documents:

### AI Agent Context & Behavior:
- AI prompt engineering guides
- AI context management strategies  
- AI hysteresis documentation
- AI behavioral modifiers
- AI response patterns
- AI training methodologies
- Custom AI instructions

### Examples of PRIVATE:
- "How to prompt this AI for best results"
- "AI memory/context management techniques"
- "Custom AI behavioral rules"
- "AI response optimization strategies"

## PUBLIC (Everything Else)
All other documentation remains public:

### Development Guides (PUBLIC):
- Security platform development guides
- Module development documentation
- API references
- Code examples
- Architecture guides
- Implementation guides

### User Documentation (PUBLIC):
- Quick start guides
- Deployment guides
- User manuals
- Command references
- Troubleshooting guides

### System Documentation (PUBLIC):
- Installation guides
- Configuration guides
- Integration guides
- Best practices for using the platform

## The Key Distinction

**PRIVATE**: Documents about how to interact with, prompt, and optimize AI agents
**PUBLIC**: Documents about the security platform itself (development, usage, deployment)

The security platform documentation is meant to be shared - it's the product.
The AI context/prompt engineering documents are your IP - they're your methods.
