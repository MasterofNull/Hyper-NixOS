# Hyper-NixOS Wizard Guide

**Complete guide to all configuration wizards with intelligent defaults**

---

## üéØ **Overview**

Hyper-NixOS includes comprehensive wizards that use **intelligent defaults** based on detected hardware and system state. All wizards follow the **Design Ethos - Third Pillar: Learning Through Guidance**.

**Core Principle**: 
> Best practices should be the path of least resistance. Every wizard detects your system, recommends optimal settings, and explains why.

## üßô **Available Wizards**

### 1. **VM Creation Wizard**
**Command**: `hv vm-create` or `/workspace/scripts/create_vm_wizard.sh`

**What it does**:
- Detects your CPU, RAM, and storage
- Pre-fills with optimal VM resources
- Explains recommendations before each choice

**Intelligent Defaults**:
```
Detected: 16 cores, 32GB RAM, NVMe storage

Recommended:
  ‚Ä¢ vCPUs: 4 (25% of host cores)
    Why: Balanced performance, host stays responsive
    
  ‚Ä¢ Memory: 8GB (2GB per vCPU)
    Why: Good VM performance, max 50% of host RAM
    
  ‚Ä¢ Disk: 40GB qcow2
    Why: Standard for Linux, qcow2 optimal for NVMe
    
  ‚Ä¢ Network: NAT

  ‚Ä¢ Firewall: NOT ACTIVE ‚ö†Ô∏è
  ‚Ä¢ SSH exposed: YES ‚ö†Ô∏è

Risk Score: HIGH

Recommended: Enhanced Security
  Why:
    ‚ö†Ô∏è No firewall detected - CRITICAL
    ‚ö†Ô∏è SSH exposed to network
    ‚ö†Ô∏è High number of open ports (23)
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Many services increase complexity
```

**Features by Level**:

   "Detected: 16 cores, 32GB RAM, NVMe storage"

2. Present recommendation
   "Recommended: 4 vCPUs (25% of host cores)"

3. Explain reasoning
   "Why: Balanced performance, host stays responsive"

4. Offer choices
   ‚Ä¢ Accept recommendation (default)
   ‚Ä¢ View details
   ‚Ä¢ Override manually
```

### Configuration
```
1. Apply selected settings
2. Save configuration file

### Quick Setup (Accept Defaults)
```bash
# Launch wizard
hv vm-create

# At each prompt, press Enter or type "recommend"
# Wizard applies intelligent defaults
# VM created with best practices
```

### Informed Override
```bash
# Launch wizard
hv security-config

# View detection: "Enhanced security recommended"
# Type security level name for details
# Read features and implications
# Type "select balanced" if enhanced is too strict
```

### Learning Mode
```bash
# Run interactive demo
hv defaults-demo

# See how detection works
# Understand reasoning
# Learn best practices
```

---

## üéØ **Best Practices**

### 1. **Always Read Detection Results**
Wizards show what they detected - verify it's correct

### 2. **Understand Recommendations**
Each recommendation includes reasoning - read it

### 3. **Accept Defaults When Learning**
Intelligent defaults teach best practices

### 4. **Override When Needed**
Experts can override for specific requirements

### 5. **Use Discovery Tools**
Run `hv discover` to see what system reports

---

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### Wizard Not Detecting Correctly?
```bash
# Run discovery manually
hv discover

# Check detection functions
source /workspace/scripts/lib/system_discovery.sh
get_cpu_cores
get_total_ram_mb
detect_storage_type
```

### Want Different Defaults?
```bash
# All wizards support manual override
# Just don't type "recommend"
# Enter your own values
```

### Need to Reconfigure?
```bash
# All wizards can be re-run
# Previous configuration is backed up
# New settings replace old ones
```
