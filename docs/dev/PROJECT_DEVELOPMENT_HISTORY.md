#### 2025-10-14: Fixed Undefined Variable Errors in Feature Modules
**Agent**: Claude
**Issue**: Build errors due to undefined variables in feature modules

**Errors Fixed**:
1. **Undefined `flatten`, `elem`, `foldl'`, etc. in feature modules**
   - Root cause: Missing `lib.` prefix for Nix library functions
   - Files affected:
     - `modules/features/feature-manager.nix`
     - `modules/features/module-loader.nix`
     - `modules/features/adaptive-docs.nix`
     - `modules/features/tier-templates.nix`
     - `modules/features/feature-categories.nix`

**Changes Applied**:
- Added `lib.` prefix to all library functions (flatten, elem, filter, unique, etc.)
- Added `pkgs.` prefix to all package references (writeScriptBin, bash, jq)
- Added `optionalString` to inherit statement in feature-categories.nix
- Updated `docs/COMMON_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md` with comprehensive guide

**Key Learning**:
- Always use explicit `lib.` prefix for library functions
- Always use explicit `pkgs.` prefix for packages
- Test modules with `nixos-rebuild dry-build --show-trace`

   - AI documentation files (AI-*.md) 
   - Implementation reports (all *.md from docs/implementation)
   - Audit and test scripts (audit-platform.sh, test-platform-features.sh, validate-implementation.sh)

2. **Reorganized Structure**:
   - Created `docs/dev/implementation/` for implementation reports
   - Moved audit scripts to `scripts/audit/`
   - Removed empty folders from public-release

**Files Moved**:
- From `public-release/docs/development/AI-*.md` â†’ `docs/dev/`
- From `public-release/docs/implementation/*.md` â†’ `docs/dev/implementation/`
- From `public-release/*-platform-*.sh` â†’ `scripts/audit/`

#### 2025-10-14: Python Code in Nix Multiline Strings
**Agent**: Claude
**Issues Fixed**:
1. **Syntax Error**: `unexpected ')', expecting '}'` in threat-response.nix:409
   - Root cause: Unescaped single quotes in Python code within Nix multiline strings
   - Fixed by escaping single quotes as `''` (double single quotes)
   
2. **Similar errors** in multiple security modules:
   - `modules/security/threat-response.nix` - Fixed .get() calls and dictionary keys
   - `modules/security/behavioral-analysis.nix` - Fixed over 50 occurrences systematically

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/security/threat-response.nix` - Escaped all Python single quotes
- `modules/security/behavioral-analysis.nix` - Systematic fix using sed
- `docs/COMMON_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md` - Added new section on Python in Nix strings
- `docs/dev/PROJECT_DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md` - This update

**Key Learnings**:
- In Nix multiline strings (`''`), literal single quotes must be escaped as `''`
- This affects all embedded code (Python, Bash, etc.) within Nix strings
- Alternative: Use double quotes in Python when possible to avoid escaping
- For complex scripts, consider separate files instead of embedding

---

#### 2025-10-13: CI Test Fixes and Build Errors
**Agent**: Claude
**Issues Fixed**:
1. **CI Test Failure**: `test_common_ci` failing due to:
   - Readonly variable conflicts in `common.sh`
   - `require` function calling `exit 1` directly
   - Strict error handling affecting test execution
   
2. **Nix Build Error**: `undefined variable 'elem'` at configuration.nix:345
   - Fixed by adding `lib.` prefix: `lib.elem`

**Files Modified**:
- `tests/unit/test_common_ci.sh` - Added sed replacements for readonly vars, disabled strict mode
- `configuration.nix` - Fixed elem reference
- `docs/dev/CI_TEST_FIXES_2025-10-13.md` - Updated with new fixes
- `docs/COMMON_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md` - Added new troubleshooting entries
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` - Added version 1.0.1 entry

**Key Learnings**:
- Always check if library variables are readonly before trying to override in tests
- Nix standard library functions need `lib.` prefix unless imported with `with lib;`
- Use subshells in tests for commands that might call `exit`
