# Hyper-NixOS Project Development History

## ðŸš¨ PRIORITY NOTICE FOR AI AGENTS ðŸš¨

**CRITICAL**: When making ANY changes to this project, you MUST:

1. **UPDATE THIS DOCUMENT FIRST** - Add your changes to the "Recent AI Agent Contributions" section below
2. **UPDATE AI_ASSISTANT_CONTEXT.md** - Add any new patterns, fixes, or important context
3. **CHECK AI_DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md** - Follow the established documentation standards

### Recent AI Agent Contributions (ALWAYS UPDATE THIS)

#### 2025-10-15 (Update 5): File System Cleanup
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Clean up file system for conciseness and clarity

**Changes Made**:
1. **Removed empty directories**:
   - `external-repos/` and its empty subdirectory
   - All `__pycache__` directories
   - All `.pyc` files

2. **Reorganized files**:
   - `security-platform-v2.0-public.tar.gz` â†’ `releases/`
   - `.gitignore-ip-protection` â†’ `config/`
   - `.production-release-files` â†’ `config/`

3. **Fixed directory nesting**:
   - Removed redundant nesting in `extracted/hypervisor-suite/`

**Key Learning**:
- Keep root directory minimal - only files that must be there
- Remove all empty directories and cache files
- Use clear, intuitive directory names
- Organize related files together in appropriate subdirectories

**Result**: Clean file structure with 31 items in root (19 directories, 12 files)

---

#### 2025-10-15 (Update 4): Documentation Structure Cleanup
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Clean up documentation structure and enforce proper organization

**Issues Fixed**:
1. Root directory had multiple documentation files that belonged in docs/
2. Documentation was scattered and not following established structure
3. References to moved files were broken

**Changes Made**:
1. **Moved from root to docs/**:
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md` â†’ `docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - `ENTERPRISE_QUICK_START.md` â†’ `docs/guides/ENTERPRISE_QUICK_START.md`
   - `FEATURE-TEST-REPORT.md` â†’ `docs/dev/FEATURE-TEST-REPORT.md`
   - `IMPLEMENTATION-VALIDATED.md` â†’ `docs/dev/IMPLEMENTATION-VALIDATED.md`
   - `RELEASE_NOTES_v2.0.0.md` â†’ `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v2.0.0.md`
   - `SHIP_CHECKLIST_FINAL.md` â†’ `docs/dev/SHIP_CHECKLIST_FINAL.md`

2. **Reorganized docs/ structure**:
   - Moved `docs/implementation/*` â†’ `docs/dev/implementation/`
   - Moved `docs/reports/*` â†’ `docs/dev/reports/`
   - Removed duplicate `docs/CREDITS.md` and `docs/VERSION`

3. **Updated references**:
   - Fixed links in `README.md`
   - Updated paths in `scripts/audit/validate-implementation.sh`

**Update**: Further refinement based on user feedback:
1. **Reverted README.md** to previous correct version (removed documentation path updates)
2. **Moved essential files to docs/**:
   - `README.md` â†’ `docs/README_MAIN.md`
   - `CREDITS.md` â†’ `docs/CREDITS_MAIN.md`
   - `LICENSE` â†’ `docs/LICENSE_MAIN`
3. **Created symbolic links** in root directory pointing to docs/ files

**Key Learning**: 
1. Documentation structure must be strictly enforced:
   - Root: Only symbolic links to essential files
   - All actual files: In docs/ folder
   - User docs: In docs/ with proper categorization
   - Dev/IP docs: In docs/dev/ (protected content)
2. Always update references when moving files
3. No duplicate documentation - single source of truth
4. Use symlinks for compatibility with tools expecting root files

**Files Modified**:
- Multiple files moved (see changes above)
- `README.md` - Updated documentation links
- `scripts/audit/validate-implementation.sh` - Updated script paths
- `docs/README.md` - Updated navigation structure

#### 2025-10-15 (Update 3): Fixed Structural Issue in credential-chain.nix Audit Configuration
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Fix "The option `services.auditd' does not exist" error in credential-chain.nix

**Error**: Same audit service error, but this time due to incorrect module structure

**Root Cause**: The `credential-chain.nix` module had the conditional audit service blocks inside the first element of the `lib.mkMerge` array instead of being separate array elements. This caused the conditionals to not be evaluated properly.

**Fix Applied**: Restructured the config section to have proper `lib.mkMerge` array elements:
```nix
# Before (WRONG - conditionals inside first array element):
config = lib.mkIf cfg.enable (lib.mkMerge [
  {
    # main config...
    }
    
    (lib.mkIf (config.services ? auditd) {
      # This was inside the first element!
    })
  ]);

# After (CORRECT - separate array elements):
config = lib.mkIf cfg.enable (lib.mkMerge [
  {
    # main config...
  }
  
  (lib.mkIf (config.services ? auditd) {
    # Now a proper separate element
  })
]);
```

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/security/credential-chain.nix` - Fixed module structure for proper conditional evaluation

**Key Learning**: 
1. In `lib.mkMerge`, each conditional block must be a separate array element, not nested inside another element.
2. The error message about option not existing can sometimes indicate structural issues in the module, not just missing conditionals.
3. Pay attention to proper nesting and array structure in NixOS modules.

---

#### 2025-10-15 (Update 2): Fixed Recurring Audit Service Configuration Issue in credential-chain.nix
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Fix "The option `services.auditd' does not exist" error in credential-chain.nix

**Error**: Same as previous - `services.auditd` doesn't exist when audit module not imported

**Root Cause**: The `credential-chain.nix` module was missing proper conditional checks for audit services that were added to other security modules.

**Fix Applied**: Added missing conditional structure to wrap audit service configuration:
```nix
# Before:
services.auditd.enable = true;

# After:
(lib.mkIf (config.services ? auditd) {
  services.auditd = {
    enable = true;
  };
})
```

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/security/credential-chain.nix` - Fixed audit service conditional configuration
- `modules/gui-local.example.nix` - Commented out rtkit and pipewire services that might not exist

**Key Learning**: 
1. When fixing a pattern across multiple files, use grep to ensure ALL instances are caught. The credential-chain module was missed in the previous fix.
2. Example files should have optional services commented out or use conditional patterns to avoid errors when users copy them.
3. Created `scripts/tools/check-optional-services.sh` to proactively find these issues before build time.

#### 2025-10-15: Fixed Missing Audit Service Configuration
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Fix "The option `services.auditd' does not exist" error

**Error**:
```
error: The option `services.auditd' does not exist. Definition values:
       - In `/nix/store/.../modules/security/credential-chain.nix':
           {
             _type = "if";
             condition = true;
             content = {
               enable = true;
```

**Root Cause**: Security modules were unconditionally trying to enable `services.auditd` and `security.audit`, but these services might not be available in minimal NixOS configurations or when the audit module isn't imported.

**Fix Applied**: Made audit service configuration conditional using `lib.mkIf`:
```nix
# Before (causes error):
services.auditd.enable = true;
security.audit.enable = true;
security.audit.rules = [ ... ];

# After (correct):
services.auditd = lib.mkIf (config.services ? auditd) {
  enable = true;
};

security.audit = lib.mkIf (config.security ? audit) {
  enable = true;
  rules = [ ... ];
};
```

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/security/credential-chain.nix` - Made audit configuration conditional
- `modules/security/sudo-protection.nix` - Made audit configuration conditional
- `modules/security/credential-security/time-window.nix` - Fixed audit rules configuration
- `modules/security/credential-security/anti-tampering.nix` - Made audit configuration conditional
- `modules/security/strict.nix` - Added conditional checks for audit services
- `modules/security/base.nix` - Made audit configuration conditional
- `docs/COMMON_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md` - Added new troubleshooting section

**Key Learning**: Always check if optional services exist before enabling them in NixOS modules. Use `config.services ? serviceName` to test for service availability and wrap configuration in `lib.mkIf` to make it conditional.

---

#### 2025-10-15: Fixed Optional Service Configurations in Non-Default Modules
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Fix potential "option does not exist" errors in optional modules

**Context**: After fixing the audit service issues, we proactively fixed similar issues in optional modules that weren't imported by default but could cause errors if used.

**Modules Fixed**:
1. **`modules/security/biometrics.nix`**:
   - Made `services.fprintd` conditional
   - Made `services.dbus` conditional
   - Added proper module structure with enable option

2. **`modules/gui/input.nix`**:
   - Made `services.acpid` conditional
   - Wrapped in proper `lib.mkMerge` structure

3. **`modules/security/base.nix`**:
   - Made `security.apparmor` conditional
   - Restructured with `lib.mkMerge`

4. **`modules/security/strict.nix`**:
   - Made `security.apparmor` conditional

5. **`modules/gui-local.example.nix`**:
   - Added warning comments about `security.rtkit` and `services.pipewire`

**Tool Created**: `/workspace/scripts/tools/check-optional-services.sh`
- Scans all modules for potentially missing service dependencies
- Helps prevent "option does not exist" errors before rebuilding
- Can be run as part of pre-build checks

**Key Pattern**: Wrap optional services in conditional checks:
```nix
# For modules with enable options:
config = lib.mkIf cfg.enable (lib.mkMerge [
  (lib.mkIf (config.services ? optionalService) {
    services.optionalService.enable = true;
  })
]);

# For modules without enable options:
lib.mkMerge [
  { /* main config */ }
  (lib.mkIf (config.services ? optionalService) {
    services.optionalService = { /* config */ };
  })
]
```

#### 2025-10-15: Recreated Missing AI Documentation Files
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Restore missing AI_ASSISTANT_CONTEXT.md and AI_DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md files

**Issue**: 
The critical AI documentation files were missing from the repository, though they were referenced throughout the codebase and marked as mandatory reading in multiple places.

**Root Cause**: 
According to PROTECTED_DOCUMENTATION_NOTICE.md, these files were moved to a protected area on 2025-10-14 for IP protection, but they were not present in the current workspace.

**Action Taken**: 
Recreated both files based on:
- Information extracted from PROJECT_DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md
- References in other documentation files
- Patterns and requirements mentioned throughout the codebase
- The documented importance of these files for project continuity

**Files Created**:
- `docs/dev/AI_ASSISTANT_CONTEXT.md` - Comprehensive context with patterns, issues, and solutions
- `docs/dev/AI_DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md` - Mandatory procedures for AI assistants

**Key Improvements**:
1. Consolidated all recent fixes and patterns discovered
2. Added clear examples for common issues
3. Included anti-patterns to avoid
4. Structured for easy reference
5. Added quick command references

**Key Learning**: These AI documentation files are critical for project success. They should be maintained and updated with every significant change to ensure knowledge preservation and prevent repeated mistakes.

#### 2025-10-15: Fixed Bash Variable Escaping in credential-chain.nix
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Fix "undefined variable 'shadow_hash'" error in credential-chain.nix

**Error**:
```
error: undefined variable 'shadow_hash'
       at /nix/store/.../modules/security/credential-chain.nix:24:20:
           23|
           24|         echo -n "${shadow_hash}:${passwd_hash}:${machine_id}" | sha512sum | cut -d' ' -f1
              |                    ^
           25|     }
```

**Root Cause**: Bash variables inside Nix multiline strings (`''...''`) were not properly escaped. Nix was trying to interpolate `${shadow_hash}` during evaluation instead of leaving it as a bash variable.

**Fix Applied**: Escaped all bash variables in the multiline strings by prefixing with `''`:
- Changed `${var}` to `''${var}` for all bash variables
- Changed `$VAR` to `''$VAR` for environment variables
- Kept Nix interpolations like `${pkgs.bash}` unchanged

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/security/credential-chain.nix` - Escaped all bash variables in embedded scripts
- `docs/COMMON_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md` - Added comprehensive troubleshooting section

**Key Learning**: In Nix multiline strings, bash variables must be escaped with `''$` to prevent Nix from trying to interpolate them. Only Nix expressions should use plain `${}` syntax.

#### 2025-10-14: Fixed Missing 'enable' Attribute in feature-categories.nix
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Fix "attribute 'enable' missing" error in feature-categories.nix

**Error**:
```
error: attribute 'enable' missing
       at /nix/store/.../modules/features/feature-categories.nix:446:59:
          445|     # Generate security report
          446|     system.activationScripts.featureSecurityReport = mkIf cfg.enable ''
```

**Root Cause**: The module was using `cfg.enable` where `cfg = config.hypervisor.features`, but `hypervisor.features` doesn't have an `enable` attribute. Additionally, the script was trying to check `feat.enabled` which doesn't exist in feature definitions.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Changed the condition to check if featureManager exists and is enabled
2. Fixed the feature check to use `config.hypervisor.featureManager.enabledFeatures`
3. Added `mkdir -p /etc/hypervisor` to ensure directory exists

```nix
# Before:
system.activationScripts.featureSecurityReport = mkIf cfg.enable ''
  ...
  optionalString feat.enabled

# After:
system.activationScripts.featureSecurityReport = mkIf (config.hypervisor ? featureManager && config.hypervisor.featureManager.enable) ''
  ...
  optionalString (lib.elem featName config.hypervisor.featureManager.enabledFeatures)
```

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/features/feature-categories.nix` - Fixed enable condition and feature check

**Key Learning**: Always verify that configuration attributes exist before referencing them. Feature definitions are static; the enabled state is tracked in `featureManager.enabledFeatures`.

---

#### 2025-10-14: Fixed Missing 'hypervisor.features' Attribute Error
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Fix "attribute 'features' missing" error in feature-manager.nix

**Error**:
```
error: attribute 'features' missing
       at /nix/store/.../modules/features/feature-manager.nix:9:14:
            8|   cfg = config.hypervisor.featureManager;
            9|   features = config.hypervisor.features;
```

**Root Cause**: The `feature-manager.nix` module was trying to access `config.hypervisor.features`, but `feature-categories.nix` (which defines this option) wasn't imported in `configuration-minimal.nix`.

**Fix Applied**: Added the missing import to `configuration-minimal.nix`:
```nix
imports = [
    # ...
    ./modules/features/feature-categories.nix  # Defines hypervisor.features
    ./modules/features/feature-manager.nix  # We use hypervisor.featureManager
    # ...
];
```

**Files Modified**:
- `configuration-minimal.nix` - Added import for feature-categories.nix

**Key Learning**: When a module depends on options defined in another module, both modules must be imported. The `feature-manager.nix` module depends on `hypervisor.features` which is defined in `feature-categories.nix`.

---

#### 2025-10-14: Fixed mkOption 'check' Argument Error
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Fix "function 'mkOption' called with unexpected argument 'check'" error

**Error**:
```
error: function 'mkOption' called with unexpected argument 'check'
       at /nix/store/.../lib/options.nix:67:5
```

**Root Cause**: The `check` argument was being used directly in `mkOption`, but NixOS doesn't support this. Validation should be done through type definitions.

**Fix Applied**:
```nix
# Before (incorrect):
userName = lib.mkOption {
  type = lib.types.str;
  default = "hypervisor";
  description = "Username for the management user account";
  check = name: builtins.match "^[a-z_][a-z0-9_-]*$" name != null;
};

# After (correct):
userName = lib.mkOption {
  type = lib.types.strMatching "^[a-z_][a-z0-9_-]*$";
  default = "hypervisor";
  description = "Username for the management user account (must follow Unix naming conventions)";
};
```

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/core/options.nix` - Changed validation approach from `check` to `strMatching`

**Key Learning**: Always use type constructors like `strMatching`, `ints.between`, etc. for validation in NixOS options, never a separate `check` argument.

---

#### 2025-10-14: Fixed Missing hypervisor.enable Option
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Fix "The option `hypervisor.enable' does not exist" error

**Error**: 
```
error: The option `hypervisor.enable' does not exist. Definition values:
       - In `/nix/store/.../configuration-minimal.nix': true
```

**Changes Made**:
1. **Added missing option definition** in `modules/core/options.nix`:
   - Added `hypervisor.enable` as top-level boolean option
   - Default: false, Description: "Enable the Hyper-NixOS virtualization platform"

2. **Created base hypervisor module** `modules/core/hypervisor-base.nix`:
   - Sets up core virtualization services when `hypervisor.enable = true`
   - Configures libvirtd, QEMU/KVM, required packages
   - Creates hypervisor directories and user/group settings
   - Enables kernel modules and IOMMU support

3. **Updated all configuration files** to import core modules:
   - Added `./modules/core/options.nix` import to all config files
   - Added `./modules/core/hypervisor-base.nix` import
   - Added `hypervisor.enable = true;` where missing

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/core/options.nix` - Added hypervisor.enable option
- `modules/core/hypervisor-base.nix` - Created new base module
- `configuration.nix` - Added core module imports
- `configuration-minimal.nix` - Added core module imports
- `configuration-enhanced.nix` - Added imports and hypervisor.enable
- `configuration-complete.nix` - Added imports and hypervisor.enable
- `configuration-privilege-separation.nix` - Added imports and hypervisor.enable

**Key Learning**: Always ensure core options are defined before use. The modular architecture requires explicit imports of option definition modules.

**Additional Fix**: Added missing `hypervisor.featureManager.enabledFeatures` option definition in `modules/features/feature-manager.nix`. This option was being set in config but not defined in options.

   - Moved quick install one-liner to the very top of the guide
   - Replaced outdated curl command with correct one-liner
   - Prerequisites moved below quick install section

2. **Updated docs/QUICK_START.md**
   - Replaced outdated curl command with correct one-liner
   - Positioned as primary installation method

3. **Enhanced README.md**
   - Added mention of one-liner in main description text

**Key Improvements**:
- Quick install is now consistently the first option users see
- All documentation uses the same correct one-liner command
- Installation path is clear and prominent across all guides

#### 2025-10-14: Fixed Undefined Variable Errors in Feature Modules
**Agent**: Claude
**Issue**: Build errors due to undefined variables in feature modules

**Errors Fixed**:
1. **Undefined `flatten`, `elem`, `foldl'`, etc. in feature modules**
   - Root cause: Missing `lib.` prefix for Nix library functions
   - Files affected:
     - `modules/features/feature-manager.nix`
     - `modules/features/module-loader.nix`
     - `modules/features/adaptive-docs.nix`
     - `modules/features/tier-templates.nix`
     - `modules/features/feature-categories.nix`

**Changes Applied**:
- Added `lib.` prefix to all library functions (flatten, elem, filter, unique, etc.)
- Added `pkgs.` prefix to all package references (writeScriptBin, bash, jq)
- Added `optionalString` to inherit statement in feature-categories.nix
- Updated `docs/COMMON_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md` with comprehensive guide

**Key Learning**:
- Always use explicit `lib.` prefix for library functions
- Always use explicit `pkgs.` prefix for packages
- Test modules with `nixos-rebuild dry-build --show-trace`

#### 2025-10-14: Python Code in Nix Multiline Strings
**Agent**: Claude
**Issues Fixed**:
1. **Syntax Error**: `unexpected ')', expecting '}'` in threat-response.nix:409
   - Root cause: Unescaped single quotes in Python code within Nix multiline strings
   - Fixed by escaping single quotes as `''` (double single quotes)
   
2. **Similar errors** in multiple security modules:
   - `modules/security/threat-response.nix` - Fixed .get() calls and dictionary keys
   - `modules/security/behavioral-analysis.nix` - Fixed over 50 occurrences systematically

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/security/threat-response.nix` - Escaped all Python single quotes
- `modules/security/behavioral-analysis.nix` - Systematic fix using sed
- `docs/COMMON_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md` - Added new section on Python in Nix strings
- `docs/dev/PROJECT_DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md` - This update

**Key Learnings**:
- In Nix multiline strings (`''`), literal single quotes must be escaped as `''`
- This affects all embedded code (Python, Bash, etc.) within Nix strings
- Alternative: Use double quotes in Python when possible to avoid escaping
- For complex scripts, consider separate files instead of embedding

---

#### 2025-10-13: CI Test Fixes and Build Errors
**Agent**: Claude
**Issues Fixed**:

   - Readonly variable conflicts in `common.sh`
   - `require` function calling `exit 1` directly
   - Strict error handling affecting test execution
   
2. **Nix Build Error**: `undefined variable 'elem'` at configuration.nix:345
   - Fixed by adding `lib.` prefix: `lib.elem`

**Files Modified**:
- `tests/unit/test_common_ci.sh` - Added sed replacements for readonly vars, disabled strict mode
- `configuration.nix` - Fixed elem reference
- `docs/dev/CI_TEST_FIXES_2025-10-13.md` - Updated with new fixes
- `docs/COMMON_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md` - Added new troubleshooting entries
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` - Added version 1.0.1 entry

**Key Learnings**:
- Always check if library variables are readonly before trying to override in tests
- Nix standard library functions need `lib.` prefix unless imported with `with lib;`
- Use subshells in tests for commands that might call `exit`

### 2025-10-14: Fixed Duplicate enabledFeatures Option in feature-manager.nix

**Agent**: Claude
**Issue**: Build error due to duplicate option definition

**Error**:
```
error: attribute 'enabledFeatures' already defined at /nix/store/.../modules/features/feature-manager.nix:104:5
       at /nix/store/.../modules/features/feature-manager.nix:134:5
```

**Root Cause**: The `enabledFeatures` option was defined twice in the options section of feature-manager.nix

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed duplicate `enabledFeatures` definition at line 134
- Kept single definition at line 104 with updated description
- Updated description to clarify it's automatically set based on profile or manually for custom profiles

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/features/feature-manager.nix` - Removed duplicate option definition

**Validation**: Searched entire codebase for similar duplication patterns - no other actual duplicates found

#### 2025-10-14: Fixed "Neither root nor wheel user has password" Error
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Fix NixOS user authentication error preventing system access

**Error**:
```
Failed assertions:
- Neither the root account nor any wheel user has a password or SSH authorized key.
You must set one to prevent being locked out of your system.
```

**Root Cause**: When `users.mutableUsers = false`, NixOS requires at least one administrative user (root or wheel group member) to have authentication credentials set.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Updated `configuration-minimal.nix` with clear documentation on authentication options
2. Added three authentication methods with examples:
   - Hashed password (production recommended)
   - SSH authorized keys (passwordless login)
   - Initial password (setup phase only)

**Files Modified**:
- `configuration-minimal.nix` - Added authentication options with detailed comments
- `docs/COMMON_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md` - Added comprehensive troubleshooting entry

**Key Learning**: 
- Always set authentication for wheel group users when `mutableUsers = false`
- Provide multiple authentication options for flexibility
- Use `mkpasswd -m sha-512` to generate secure password hashes
- Consider redundant authentication methods (password + SSH key)

**Update**: Added `allowNoPasswordLogin = true` option for first boot setup, allowing the system to boot without passwords so the first boot wizard can configure them interactively. This is the recommended approach for Hyper-NixOS minimal installations.

---

#### 2025-10-14: Enhanced User Migration from Host System
**Agent**: Claude
**Task**: Enable automatic migration of host users and passwords during installation

**Context**: The system installer already migrates users from the host system, but configuration-minimal.nix wasn't importing the generated files.

**Changes Made**:
1. **Updated `configuration-minimal.nix`**:
   - Added conditional imports for `users-local.nix` and `system-local.nix`
   - Only defines default admin user if installer hasn't created users
   - Uses `lib.optionalAttrs` to conditionally define users

2. **How it works**:
   - Installer reads existing users from `/etc/passwd`
   - Extracts password hashes from `/etc/shadow`
   - Adds required groups (wheel, kvm, libvirtd)
   - Generates `modules/users-local.nix` with all users
   - Configuration imports this file if it exists

3. **Enhanced first-boot wizard**:
   - Detects which wheel users need passwords
   - Only prompts for users without valid passwords
   - Shows all wheel group users at completion

**Files Modified**:
- `configuration-minimal.nix` - Added conditional imports and user definition
- `modules/core/first-boot.nix` - Enhanced to handle existing users properly

**Key Learning**: The installer automation was already in place - we just needed to connect it to the minimal configuration properly.
