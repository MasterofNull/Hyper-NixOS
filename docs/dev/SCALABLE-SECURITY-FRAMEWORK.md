```bash
./profile-selector.sh --show
```

#### Change Profile
```bash
# Interactive selection
./profile-selector.sh --select

# Direct profile change
./profile-selector.sh --minimal
./profile-selector.sh --standard
```

#### Auto-Detection
```bash
# Automatically select best profile based on system resources
./profile-selector.sh --auto
```

### 6. Module Configuration

Modules can be configured individually through `module-config-schema.yaml`:

```yaml
modules:
  scanner:
    enabled: true
    engines:
      nmap:
        enabled: true
        max_rate: 1000
        stealth_mode: true
    profiles:
      quick:
        timeout: 30
        ports: "top-100"
```

### 7. Resource Management

#### Memory Limits
- Minimal: < 512MB
- Standard: < 2GB
- Advanced: < 4GB
- Enterprise: < 16GB

#### CPU Limits
- Minimal: 25% max
- Standard: 50% max
- Advanced: 75% max
- Enterprise: 90% max

#### Dynamic Scaling
The framework automatically adjusts resource usage based on:
- Available system resources
- Current workload
- Priority of security events
- User-defined limits

### 8. Console Enhancement Features

#### Tmux Integration
```bash
# Launch security monitoring session
~/.security/console/tmux-security-session.sh
```

Pre-configured layouts:
- Monitoring dashboard
- Scanning workspace
- Analysis environment

#### FZF Integration
- `fsec` - Interactive security log search
- `fkill` - Process management with security context
- `fdocker` - Container security inspection

#### Notification System

### 9. Performance Optimization

#### Lightweight Mode
For resource-constrained environments:
```bash
# Enable lightweight mode
export SECURITY_LIGHTWEIGHT=true
```

Features:
- Reduced memory footprint
- Optimized scanning algorithms
- Minimal logging
- Essential features only

#### High-Performance Mode

### 10. Integration Examples

#### Docker Integration
```bash
# Minimal security for containers
docker run -v $PWD:/workspace \
  -e SECURITY_PROFILE=minimal \
  security-framework

# Full scanning capabilities
docker run --privileged \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e SECURITY_PROFILE=standard \
  security-framework
```

#### Kubernetes Integration
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: security-framework
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: security
        image: security-framework:latest
        env:
        - name: SECURITY_PROFILE
          value: "minimal"
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
```

#### Systemd Integration

# Install as system service
sudo ./modular-security-framework.sh --standard
sudo systemctl enable security-framework
sudo systemctl start security-framework
```

### 11. Scaling Guidelines

#### When to Use Each Profile

**Minimal Profile**
- Container runtime security
- Hypervisor base security
- IoT device protection
- CI/CD pipeline scanning

**Standard Profile**
- Production servers
- Developer workstations
- Small business deployments
- Cloud VM security

**Advanced Profile**
- SOC operations
- Incident response teams
- Security research
- Critical infrastructure

**Enterprise Profile**
- Large organizations
- Multi-cloud deployments
- Compliance requirements
- Full security operations

### 12. Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with minimal profile and scale up as needed
2. **Monitor Resources**: Use built-in monitoring to track resource usage
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep modules updated independently
4. **Custom Modules**: Develop organization-specific modules
5. **Profile Tuning**: Adjust profiles based on actual usage patterns

### 13. Troubleshooting

#### Profile Issues
```bash
# Reset to minimal profile
./profile-selector.sh --minimal

# Check module status
sec status --modules

# Verify resource limits
systemctl show security-framework | grep -E "(Memory|CPU)"
```

#### Performance Issues
```bash
# Check resource usage
sec status --resources

# Disable heavy modules
sec config disable ai_detection

# Enable lightweight mode
export SECURITY_LIGHTWEIGHT=true
```
