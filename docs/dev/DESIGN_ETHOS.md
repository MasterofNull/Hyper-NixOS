# Design Ethos - Hyper-NixOS

## üéØ Purpose

This document formally establishes the foundational design principles (ethos) that guide ALL decisions, implementations, and modifications in the Hyper-NixOS project. These three pillars are the ultimate authority for evaluating any change, feature, or design decision.

---

## üèõÔ∏è The Three Pillars

### **First Pillar: Ease of Use**

**Priority**: Minimize friction at ALL stages

**Scope**:
- Installation process
- Initial setup and configuration
- Daily operations and management
- System changes and updates
- Hardware compatibility
- Upgrades and migrations
- Future-proofing

**Standard**:
> **If it creates friction, it MUST be addressed and fixed.**

**Principles**:
- User should NEVER struggle with basic operations
- Complex tasks should have guided workflows (wizards, interactive tools)
- Documentation must be clear, accurate, and accessible
- Default configurations should "just work" for common use cases
- Advanced features should be available but not mandatory
- Learning curve should be gradual, not cliff-like

**Examples**:
- ‚úÖ One-line installer that detects hardware automatically
- ‚úÖ Interactive wizards for complex configurations
- ‚úÖ Sensible defaults that work out of the box
- ‚úÖ Progressive disclosure (simple ‚Üí advanced)
- ‚ùå Requiring manual editing of complex configuration files for basic tasks
- ‚ùå Cryptic error messages without guidance
- ‚ùå Breaking changes without migration tools

### **Second Pillar: Security AND Directory Structure/Organization**

**Priority**: Equal emphasis on both aspects

#### Security Component

**Standard**:
> **ALL design decisions MUST be judged against digital/cyber security best practices.**

**Scope**: EVERYTHING
- Every step of installation and setup
- Every integration and package
- Every programming language choice
- Every symlink design
- Every network configuration
- Every file permission
- Every authentication mechanism
- Every data storage decision

**Principles**:
- Security is NOT optional or "added later"
- Defense in depth - multiple layers of protection
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure by default, configurable for specific needs
- Users MUST be notified of risks when security concessions are made
- Mitigation guidance MUST be provided for known risks
- Zero-trust architecture where applicable
- Regular security audits and updates

**User Notification Requirement**:
When security concessions are necessary:
1. **Clearly explain the risk** in user-facing terms
2. **Provide mitigation steps** the user can take
3. **Offer secure alternatives** when available
4. **Document the trade-offs** in decision logs

#### Directory Structure/Organization Component

**Standard**:
> **CLEAN, MINIMAL, ORGANIZED - VERY STRICT enforcement**

**Requirements**:
- **No messy directories** - Everything has a logical place
- **No clutter** - No orphaned files, temporary files in proper temp locations
- **Well-labeled sub-directories** - Purpose clear from name
- **Consistent structure** - Similar content organized similarly
- **Documented organization** - Structure explained in docs
- **Modular separation** - Related files grouped, unrelated separated

**Principles**:
- File system organization reflects logical architecture
- Deep nesting avoided where possible (max 3-4 levels preferred)
- Similar content types in similar locations
- Scripts in `/scripts`, docs in `/docs`, configs in `/modules`
- No dumping files in root directory
- Build artifacts and caches in appropriate locations (ignored by git)
- Clear separation between user-modifiable and system files

**Examples**:
- ‚úÖ `/modules/security/threat-detection.nix` - Clear path hierarchy
- ‚úÖ `/scripts/lib/` for shared libraries, `/scripts/security/` for security tools
- ‚úÖ `/docs/dev/` for development docs, `/docs/user-guides/` for user docs
- ‚ùå Random files in root directory
- ‚ùå Scripts scattered across multiple locations
- ‚ùå Unclear or cryptic directory names

### **Third Pillar: Learning Ethos**

**Priority**: System as BOTH functional tool AND learning tool

**Vision**:
> **World-class, cutting-edge, fully featured, modular, maintainable, future ready**

**Platform Scope**:
- ARM mobile devices
- Embedded systems
- Single-board computers (SBCs)
- Laptops
- Desktop workstations
- Servers
- Cloud environments

**Dual Purpose**:

#### 1. Functional Tool
- Production-ready for real-world use
- Enterprise-grade capabilities
- Reliable, stable, maintainable
- Performant and efficient
- Extensible and customizable

#### 2. Learning Tool
- **User transformation path**: New ‚Üí Familiar ‚Üí Competent
- All user-facing elements facilitate learning
- Wizards explain WHAT, WHY, and HOW
- Documentation teaches concepts, not just steps
- Examples show best practices
- Guided workflows teach correct implementation
- Advanced users retain flexibility and control

**Learning Principles**:
- **Progressive disclosure**: Simple first, advanced later
- **Contextual education**: Teach at point of use
- **Explain trade-offs**: Help users make informed decisions
- **Show best practices**: Guide toward correct patterns
- **Provide rationale**: Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- **Enable exploration**: Safe sandboxes for experimentation
- **Celebrate progress**: Acknowledge user growth

**User-Facing Elements**:
- üìö **Guides and Documentation**: Comprehensive, clear, organized
- üéØ **Interactive Wizards**: Educational and functional
- üíª **CLI Tools**: Helpful, informative, forgiving
- üìä **Status and Feedback**: Clear, actionable information
- üîç **Error Messages**: Instructive, not cryptic
- üéì **Tutorials**: Hands-on, progressive learning
- üìñ **Examples**: Real-world, best-practice demonstrations

**Balance**:
- Beginners: Guided paths, explanations, safety rails
- Intermediate: Options, customization, deeper understanding
- Advanced: Full control, automation, extension capabilities

## üéì AI Agent Role and Responsibilities

### Decision-Making Authority

**User is the Architect and Decision-Maker**
- AI agents do NOT make high-level design or architecture decisions
- User's vision and direction is the ultimate authority
- AI training and assumptions are subordinate to user's explicit direction

### AI Agent Responsibilities

**1. PRESENT**:
- Suggestions and recommendations
- Opportunities and options
- Insights from analysis
- Relevant information and context

**2. ASK**:
- For user's thoughts on design decisions
- For direction on architecture choices
- For clarification when uncertain
- For preferences on trade-offs

**3. EXECUTE**:
- User-provided directions
- Explicitly approved plans
- Standard patterns already established
- Routine tasks within guidelines

**4. NEVER**:
- Assume user's intent without asking
- Make architectural decisions unilaterally
- Deviate from established design ethos
- Create solutions from AI's interpretation alone

### Protection Against Bad AI Outputs

**Listen First**:
- Understand user's vision before implementing
- Ask clarifying questions
- Confirm understanding before major changes

**Document Everything**:
- Record design decisions and rationale
- Maintain change history
- Preserve context for future reference

**Follow the Ethos**:
- Every decision must align with the three pillars
- When conflict arises, ask user for priority
- Design ethos prevents drift and maintains project identity

## üìè Evaluating Decisions Against The Pillars

### Decision Framework

For ANY decision, ask:

**First Pillar - Ease of Use**:
1. Does this reduce friction for users?
2. Is this easier or harder than alternatives?
3. Does this create obstacles to daily use?
4. Will users struggle with this?

**Second Pillar - Security & Organization**:
1. Does this meet security best practices?
2. Are there security risks? (If yes, notify and mitigate)
3. Is this placed in a logical, clean location?
4. Does this maintain directory organization standards?

**Third Pillar - Learning**:
1. Can users learn from this?
2. Does this guide toward best practices?
3. Is this explained adequately?
4. Does this support user growth?

### Conflict Resolution

When pillars conflict, consider:
1. **Can we satisfy all three?** (Best outcome)
2. **Can we mitigate the conflict?** (Next best)
3. **What's the user's priority?** (Ask if unclear)
4. **Document the trade-off** (Transparency)

**Example Conflict**:
- Security might add friction (Pillar 2 vs Pillar 1)
- **Resolution**: Secure by default, but provide wizard to guide users through setup (satisfies both)
