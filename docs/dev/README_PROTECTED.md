2. Contains trade secrets and proprietary methodologies
3. Essential for AI agent context and system understanding
4. Not to be shared outside the development team

### For AI Agents

**üöÄ QUICK START**: Read `AI_DOCS_INDEX.md` for navigation, then `AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for instant patterns.

**Core Documents** (Read in order):
1. `AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Instant pattern lookup (5 min)
2. `AI_ASSISTANT_CONTEXT.md` - Detailed patterns & context (20 min)
3. `AI_DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md` - How to maintain docs (15 min)
4. `AI_DOCS_INDEX.md` - Navigation hub (reference as needed)

**üö® CRITICAL RULE**: When user gives ANY feedback/suggestion:
1. Update AI docs IMMEDIATELY (without being asked)
2. Make it permanent behavior
3. Never require user to repeat themselves

**When working with these documents**:
1. Always read relevant context files before making changes
2. **Automatically update docs when user gives feedback** (NEW - most important!)
3. Update documentation after implementing fixes
4. Preserve historical context and design rationale
5. Follow the protocols defined in these documents
6. Search for pattern bugs, don't just fix individual issues
