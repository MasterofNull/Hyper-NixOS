### For AI Agents

**üö® CRITICAL: PREVENT AGENT CRASHES**

**START HERE:** Read `AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - **5-minute crash prevention guide**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue: Agent Crashes with Broad Prompts

**NEVER USE THIS PROMPT FORMAT:**
```
‚ùå "Hyper-NixOS task following dev folder conventions: [task]"
```

**WHY:** This causes agents to try reading all 30+ dev docs simultaneously, resulting in:
- Agent crashes and freezes
- Context window overflow
- Incorrect or incomplete responses

**SOLUTION:** Use specific, focused prompts. See `AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for details.

### üö® CRITICAL RULES for AI Agents

**Rule 1: Use Focused Prompts**
- ‚úÖ Reference ONE specific file or doc at a time
- ‚ùå NEVER reference "dev folder conventions" broadly
- ‚úÖ Be specific about exact locations and files

**Rule 2: When User Gives Feedback**
1. Update AI docs IMMEDIATELY (without being asked)
2. Make it permanent behavior
3. Never require user to repeat themselves

**Rule 3: Progressive Context Loading**
1. Always read relevant context files before making changes
2. Load context progressively, not all at once
3. Update documentation after implementing fixes
4. Preserve historical context and design rationale
5. Follow the protocols defined in these documents
6. Search for pattern bugs, don't just fix individual issues

**Rule 4: Avoid Crashes**
- Maximum 3-5 dev docs per task
- Use specific file references instead of broad conventions
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps
