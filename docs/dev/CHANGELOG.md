## [Unreleased]

### Changed

#### NixOS 25.05 Upgrade (2025-10-19)

- **Upgraded to NixOS 25.05** stable channel
  - Updated `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` to NixOS 25.05
  - Updated all `system.stateVersion` from "24.05" to "25.05" (fresh install)
  - Updated all documentation references to reflect NixOS 25.05

- **Fixed Hardware Graphics API** for NixOS 25.05 compatibility
  - Reverted `hardware.graphics` back to `hardware.opengl` (3 modules affected)
  - NixOS 25.05 uses the same API as 24.05 (`hardware.opengl`)
  - The `hardware.graphics` API was only in NixOS 24.11
  - Updated: `modules/core/boot.nix`, `modules/hardware/platform-detection.nix`, `modules/hardware/desktop.nix`

- **Fixed SYSTEMATIC NixOS Module Anti-Pattern** (CRITICAL)
  - **Issue**: All three hardware modules had identical anti-pattern causing build failure
  - **Severity**: System could not build ("option does not exist" error)
  - **Modules Fixed**:
    - `modules/hardware/desktop.nix` - Removed anti-pattern (commit 6cbee19)
    - `modules/hardware/laptop.nix` - Removed anti-pattern (commit 5d3b2f6)
    - `modules/hardware/server.nix` - Removed anti-pattern (commit 5d3b2f6)
  - **Changes Applied** (all three modules):
    - Removed `with lib;` statement
    - Removed top-level `let cfg = config...` binding
    - Moved `cfg` inside `config = lib.mkIf` scope
    - Added `lib.` prefix to all lib functions (200+ occurrences total)
  - **Root Cause**: Top-level config access before options defined ‚Üí circular dependency
  - **Lesson**: Check ALL similar files for systematic issues, don't assume one fix solves all
  - **Documentation**: Added comprehensive entry to AI-LESSONS-LEARNED.md
  - Prevents infinite recursion and evaluation order issues

## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 0.9.x to 1.0.0

1. **Backup your configuration:**
   ```bash
   sudo cp -r /etc/nixos /etc/nixos.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

2. **Review breaking changes:**
   - Privilege separation is now mandatory (not opt-in)
   - Password protection module is always enabled
   - Some wizard scripts renamed (use `hv` command)

3. **Update configuration:**
   ```bash
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch
   ```

4. **Verify functionality:**
   ```bash
   hv help
   virsh list --all
   ```

### Upgrading from 0.5.x to 1.0.0

Due to significant architectural changes, we recommend a fresh installation for upgrades from 0.5.x. Contact support for assistance with data migration.

## Deprecation Notices

### Deprecated in 1.0.0
- **Old wizard naming**: `setup_wizard.sh` ‚Üí Use `hv setup` instead
- **Direct script execution**: Run wizards via `hv` command for consistency
- **Unprotected sudo**: All new sudo rules are granular and specific

### Removed in 1.0.0
- Legacy credential storage (migrated to secure storage)
- Unrestricted NOPASSWD sudo rules
- Hardcoded configuration paths
