# Monitoring System Enhancements

## Current State
- Basic Prometheus metrics export
- Simple health checks
- Console-based metrics viewing

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Web-based Dashboard
- Implement Grafana dashboard for visualization
- Add real-time VM performance graphs
- Create alerting rules for critical events

### 2. Enhanced Metrics Collection
```bash
# Additional metrics to collect:
- VM disk I/O statistics
- Network throughput per VM
- CPU temperature and power consumption
- Memory pressure indicators
- Security event counts
```

### 3. Alerting System
- Email/SMS notifications for critical events
- Slack/Discord integration for team notifications
- Escalation policies for different severity levels

### 4. Log Aggregation
- Centralized logging with structured format
- Log rotation and retention policies
- Search and analysis capabilities

## Implementation Priority
1. Web dashboard (High)
2. Enhanced metrics (Medium)
3. Alerting system (Medium)
4. Log aggregation (Low)
